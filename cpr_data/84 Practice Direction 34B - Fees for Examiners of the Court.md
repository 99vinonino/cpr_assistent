## Scope
### 1.1
This practice direction sets out –
(1) how to calculate the fees an examiner of the court (‘an examiner’) may charge; and
(2) the expenses he may recover.
(CPR Rule 34.8 (3) (b) provides that the court may make an order for evidence to be obtained by the examination of a witness before an examiner of the court).
### 1.2
The party who obtained the order for the examination must pay the fees and expenses of the examiner.
(CPR rule 34.14 permits an examiner to charge a fee for the examination and contains other provisions about his fees and expenses, and rule 34.15 provides who may be appointed as an examiner of the court).

## The examination fee
### 2.1
An examiner may charge an hourly rate for each hour (or part of an hour) that he is engaged in examining the witness.
### 2.2
The hourly rate is to be calculated by reference to the formula set out in paragraph 3.
### 2.3
The examination fee will be the hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours the examination has taken. For example –
Examination fee = hourly rate x number of hours.

## How to calculate the hourly rate – the formula
### 3.1
Divide the amount of the minimum annual salary of a post within Group 7 of the judicial salary structure as designated by the Review Body on Senior Salaries[1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part34/pd_part34b#f0300), by 220 to give **‘x’** ; and then divide **‘x’** by

**6** to give **the hourly rate**.
For example –  
---  
| minimum annual salary  
---  
220  
= x  
minimum annual salary  
220  
---  
| x  
---  
6  
= hourly rate  
x  
6

## Single fee chargeable on making the appointment for examination
### 4.1
An examiner of court is also entitled to charge a single fee of twice the hourly rate (calculated in accordance with paragraph 3 above) as ‘the appointment fee’ when the appointment for the examination is made.
### 4.2
The examiner is entitled to retain the appointment fee where the witness fails to attend on the date and time arranged.
### 4.3
Where the examiner fails to attend on the date and time arranged he may not charge a further appointment fee for arranging a subsequent appointment.
(The examiner need not send the deposition to the court until his fees are paid – see CPR rule 34.14 (2)).
