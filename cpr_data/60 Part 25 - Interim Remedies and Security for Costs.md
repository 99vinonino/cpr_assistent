(5) Section II of this Part contains additional provisions relating to interim injunctions.
(6) Sections III to VI of this Part contain additional provisions relating to specific types of interim remedy.

(2) Save where the applicant reasonably believes that there is good reason for not giving notice, the applicant must serve the application notice, evidence in support, draft order and notice of the date, time and place of the hearing as soon as possible after filing and in any event not less than 3 days before the hearing date for the application.
(3) Where an application is made on paper, sufficient copies of the application notice and evidence in support for the court and for each respondent must be filed for issue and service.
(4) Whenever possible, the applicant must—
(a)file a draft of the order sought with the application notice; and
(b)provide an electronic version of the draft order to the court, in a format compatible with enabling the draft to be amended by the court.
##### Evidence

**25.7.** —(1) Applications must be supported by evidence in the following form unless the court, a rule, a practice direction or an enactment requires an affidavit or affirmation—
(a)a witness statement;
(b)a statement of case; or
(c)the application.
(2) The evidence must set out all relevant facts.
##### Applications without notice

**25.8.** —(1) Where the applicant reasonably believes that there is good reason for not giving the required notice, and where the application is to be dealt with at a court hearing—
(a)the application notice, supporting evidence and a draft order must be filed with the court at least two hours before the hearing wherever possible;
(b)if an application is made before the application notice has been issued, a draft order must be provided at the hearing, and the application notice and evidence in support must be filed with the court on the same or next working day or as ordered by the court;
(c)except in cases where the applicant reasonably believes that secrecy is essential, the applicant must take steps to notify the respondent of the application; and
(d)the applicant must take or arrange to be taken a note of the hearing and serve this on the respondent.
(2) Where the application is to be dealt with at a court hearing before the issue of a claim form, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (1)—
(a)unless the court orders otherwise, either the applicant must undertake to the court to issue a claim form immediately or the court must give directions for the commencement of the claim;
(b)where possible the claim form must be served with the order for the injunction; and

(b)the application notice and evidence in support must be filed with the court on the day of the hearing or next working day or as ordered, together with two copies of the order for sealing where the application is made on paper.
(Further information about the procedure for urgent applications, including urgent out of hours applications, may be found in the relevant court guide, on the HMCTS website, or by contacting the court directly.)
##### Form of order

**25.9.** —(1) An order for an interim injunction must set out clearly what the respondent must do or not do.
(2) An order for an interim injunction made in the presence of all parties to be bound by it or made at a hearing of which they have had notice, may state that it is effective until trial or further order.
(3) Unless the court orders otherwise, an order for an interim injunction must contain—
(a)subject to paragraph (6), an undertaking by the applicant to the court to pay any damages which the respondent sustains and which the court considers the applicant should pay;
(b)if made without notice to any other party, an undertaking by the applicant to the court to serve on the respondent the application notice, evidence in support, note of the hearing and any order made as soon as practicable;
(c)if made without notice to any other party, a return date for a further hearing at which the other party can be present;
(d)if made before filing the application notice, an undertaking to file and pay the appropriate fee on the same or next working day; and
(e)if made before issue of a claim form, an undertaking to issue and pay the appropriate fee on the same or next working day, or directions for the commencement of the claim.
(4) When the court makes an order for delivery up or preservation of evidence or property which is likely to be executed at the premises of the respondent or a third party, it must consider whether to include provisions for the benefit or protection of those parties.
(5) Subject to paragraph (6), when the court makes an order for an interim injunction, it must consider whether to require an undertaking by the applicant to pay any damages sustained by a person other than the respondent, including another party to the proceedings or any other person who may suffer loss as a consequence of the order.
(6) In an Aarhus Convention claim to which rules 46.24 to 46.28 apply, if the court is satisfied that an interim injunction is necessary to prevent significant environmental damage and to preserve the factual basis of the proceedings, the court must, in considering whether to require an undertaking by the applicant, and the terms of any such undertaking—
(a)have regard to the need for the terms of the order not to make continuing with the claim prohibitively expensive for the applicant; and
(b)give such directions as are necessary to ensure that the case is heard promptly.
(7) In this Section ‘Aarhus Convention claim’ has the same meaning as in rule 46.24(2).
(8) Proceedings are ‘prohibitively expensive’ if their likely costs, including any court fees payable by the applicant and the amount of any cross-undertaking in damages, and having regard to any limit under Part 46 on a party’s maximum costs liability, either exceed the financial resources of the applicant, or are objectively unreasonable having regard to the factors set out in rule 46.27(3)(b).
(9) When a court considers the financial resources of the applicant, it must have regard to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to the applicant.
##### Interim injunction to cease if claim is stayed or automatically struck out

**25.10.** —(1) If a claim is stayed other than by agreement between the parties, any interim injunction (other than a freezing injunction) granted in or in anticipation of the claim shall cease to have effect, unless the court orders otherwise.
(2) If a claim is automatically struck out, any interim injunction granted to the claimant in or in anticipation of the claim shall cease to have effect 14 days after the claim is struck out, unless the court orders otherwise or paragraph (3) applies.
(3) If a claimant applies within 14 days to reinstate a claim that has been automatically struck out, any interim injunction granted to them in or in anticipation of the claim shall continue until the hearing of the application, unless the court orders otherwise.
(Rules 20.2 and 20.3 provide that counterclaims and other additional claims are treated as claims and that references to a claimant include a party bringing an additional claim.)
##### Injunctions against third parties

**25.11.** —(1) The following provisions apply to orders which will affect a person, other than the applicant or respondent, who is served with the order but did not attend the hearing at which the order was made.
(2) Where such a person requests—
(a)a copy of any material provided to the judge, including material prepared after the hearing at the direction of the judge or in compliance with the order; or
(b)a note of the hearing,
the applicant or their legal representative must comply with the request forthwith, unless the court orders otherwise.

**25.15.** This Section applies to applications for search orders, imaging orders, or both.

##### Evidence

**25.17.** —(1) An application must be supported by evidence on affidavit or affirmation.
(2) The affidavit or affirmation must—
(a)state the address of the premises and whether it is a private or business address;
(b)state the name, firm and its address, and experience of the Supervising Solicitor and, where an imaging order is sought, the independent IT expert; and
(c)fully disclose the reason the order is sought, including the probability that relevant material would disappear if the order were not made.
##### Form of order

**25.18.** —(1) The applicant must use the wording of the model search and imaging order in the form approved in accordance with rule 4(1), modified as appropriate.
(2) Any modifications to the model order must be drawn to the judge’s attention at the application hearing.

#### SECTION VInterim Payment Orders
##### Court’s powers

**25.20.** —(1) The court must not order an interim payment of more than a reasonable proportion of the likely amount of the final judgment.
(2) The court must take into account contributory negligence and any relevant set-off or counterclaim.
(3) The court may order an interim payment by instalments. If so, the order must set out—
(a)the total amount of the payment;
(b)the amount of each instalment;
(c)the number of instalments and the date on which each is to be paid; and
(d)to whom payment should be made.
(4) Where a party seeks an interim payment and the court has ordered an account to be taken, if on the evidence the account is bound to result in a payment to the applicant, the court must, before making an order for interim payment, order that the liable party pay to the applicant the amount shown by the account to be due.
(5) The permission of the court must be obtained before making a voluntary interim payment in respect of a claim by a child or protected party. ‘Child’ and ‘protected party’ have the same meanings as in rule 21.1(2).
(6) The court may adjust any interim payment whether or not any payment has yet been made (voluntarily or under a previously made order). The court may in particular—
(a)order all or part of the interim payment to be repaid;
(b)vary or discharge the order for the interim payment;
(c)order a defendant to reimburse, either wholly or partly, another defendant who has made an interim payment.
(7) The court may make an order under paragraph (6)(c) only if—
(a)the defendant to be reimbursed has claimed against the other defendant for a contribution, indemnity or other remedy; and
(b)where the claim to which the interim payment relates has not been discontinued or disposed of, the circumstances are such that the court could make an interim payment order under this Section.
(8) Where a defendant has made an interim payment, and the amount of the payment is more than their total liability under the final judgment or order, the court may award them interest on the overpaid amount from the date when they made the interim payment.
(Practice Direction 40B, paragraphs 6.1 to 6.4 provide further information concerning adjustment of the final judgment sum.)
##### Applications

**25.21.** —(1) The claimant may not apply for an interim payment order before the end of the period for filing an acknowledgment of service applicable to the defendant against whom the application is made.
(Rule 10.3 sets out the period for filing an acknowledgment of service.)
(2) The claimant may make more than one application for an interim payment order.
(3) A copy of the application notice must be served at least 14 days before the hearing of the application and must be supported by evidence.
(4) If the respondent wishes to rely on written evidence at the hearing, they must file the written evidence and serve copies on every other party to the application at least 7 days before the hearing.
(5) If the applicant wishes to rely on written evidence in reply, they must file the written evidence and serve a copy on the respondent at least 3 days before the hearing.
(6) This rule does not require written evidence to be filed if it has already been filed, or to be served on a party on whom it has already been served.
(7) The court may make an order under this rule without an application by any party if it makes the order when it disposes of the claim or any part of it.
##### Evidence

**25.22.** —(1) An application for an interim payment order must be supported by evidence dealing with—
(a)the sum of money sought by way of an interim payment;
(b)the items or matters in respect of which the interim payment is sought;
(c)the sum of money for which final judgment is likely to be given;
(d)the reasons for believing that the conditions set out in rule 25.23 are satisfied;
(e)any other relevant matters;
(f)in claims for personal injuries, details of special damages and past and future loss; and
(g)in a claim under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976([4](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2025/106/schedule/made#f00010)), details of the person(s) on whose behalf the claim is made and the nature of the claim.
(2) Any documents in support of the application must be exhibited, including, in personal injuries claims, any medical report.
##### Conditions to be satisfied

**25.23.** The court may only make an interim payment order where any of the following conditions are satisfied—
(a)the defendant against whom the order is sought has admitted liability to pay damages or another sum of money to the claimant;
(b)the claimant has obtained judgment against that defendant for damages to be assessed, or for another sum of money (other than costs) to be assessed;
(c)it is satisfied that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money (other than costs) against the defendant from whom they are seeking an interim payment, whether or not that defendant is the only defendant or one of several;
(e)the claimant is seeking an order for possession of land (whether or not any other order is also sought), and the court is satisfied that, if the case went to trial, the defendant would be held liable (even if the claim for possession fails) to pay the claimant a sum of money for the defendant’s occupation and use of the land while the claim for possession was pending; or
(f)there are two or more defendants and the order is sought against any one or more of them, and—
(i)the court is satisfied that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money (other than costs) against at least one of the defendants (but the court cannot determine which); and
(ii)all the defendants are either public bodies; or insured in respect of the claim; or are defendants whose liability will be met by an insurer under section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988([5](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2025/106/schedule/made#f00011)), or an insurer acting under the Motor Insurers Bureau Agreement, or the Motor Insurers Bureau where it is acting itself.
##### Compensation recovery payments

**25.24.** —(1) Where in a claim for personal injuries there is a contested application for interim payment of damages, the defendant must obtain a certificate from the Secretary of State (as defined in rule 36.20(1)(e)) where the claim—
(a)falls under the heads of damage set out in column 1 of Schedule 2 to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997([6](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2025/106/schedule/made#f00012)) (‘the 1997 Act’) in respect of recoverable benefits received by the claimant set out in column 2 of that Schedule, or includes damages in respect of a disease for which a lump sum payment within the definition in section 1A(2) of the 1997 Act has been, or is likely to be made; and
(b)the defendant is liable to pay a recoverable amount (as defined in rule 36.20(1)(c)) to the Secretary of State.
(2) A copy of the certificate must be filed at the hearing of the application.
(3) The order must set out the deductible amount (as defined in rule 36.20(1)(d)).
(4) The payment made to the claimant must be the net amount but for the purpose of calculating the payment after the final judgment, the gross amount of the interim payment must be used.
##### Restriction on disclosure

**25.25.** The fact that a defendant has made an interim payment, whether voluntarily or by court order, shall not be disclosed to the trial judge until all questions of liability and the amount of money to be awarded have been decided, unless that defendant agrees.
#### SECTION VI Security for Costs
##### Applications

**25.26.** —(1) A defendant to any claim may apply for security for their costs of the proceedings.
(Part 3 provides for the court to order payment of sums into court in other circumstances. Rule 20.3 provides for this Section to apply to counterclaims or other additional claims.)
(2) An application for security for costs must be supported by written evidence.
(3) Where the court makes an order for security for costs, it must determine the amount of security, and direct the manner and time within which the security must be given.
##### Conditions to be satisfied

**25.27.** The court may make an order for security for costs if—
(a)it is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that it is just to make such an order; and
(b)either an enactment permits the court to require security for costs, or one or more of the following conditions apply—
(i)the claimant is resident out of the jurisdiction;
(ii)the claimant is a company or other body (whether incorporated inside or outside England and Wales) and there is reason to believe that it will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs if ordered to do so;
(iii)the claimant has changed their address since the claim was commenced with a view to evading the consequences of the litigation;
(iv)the claimant failed to give their address in the claim form, or gave an incorrect address;
(v)the claimant is acting as a nominal claimant, other than as a representative claimant under Part 19, and there is reason to believe that they will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs if ordered to do so;
(vi)the claimant has taken steps in relation to their assets that would make it difficult to enforce an order for costs against them.
##### Security for costs other than from the claimant

**25.28.** The defendant may seek a security for costs order against a person other than the claimant, and the court may make such an order, if—
(a)the court is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that it is just to make such an order;
(b)the person has assigned the right to the claim to the claimant with a view to avoiding the possibility of a costs order being made against them, or has contributed or agreed to contribute to the claimant’s costs in return for a share of any recovery in the proceedings; and
(c)the person is someone against whom a costs order may be made.
##### Security for costs of an appeal

**25.29.** —(1) The court may order security for costs of an appeal against an appellant, or a respondent who also appeals, on the same grounds as it may order security for costs against a claimant.
(2) The court may also make such an order where the appellant, or the respondent who also appeals, is a limited company and there is reason to believe it will be unable to pay the costs of the other parties to the appeal should its appeal be unsuccessful.
