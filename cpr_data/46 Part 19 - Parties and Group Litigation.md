### Effect of the GLO

**19.23**
(1) Where a judgment or order is given or made in a claim on the group register in relation to one or more GLO issues –
(a) that judgment or order is binding on the parties to all other claims that are on the group register at the time the judgment is given or the order is made unless the court orders otherwise; and
(b) the court may give directions as to the extent to which that judgment or order is binding on the parties to any claim which is subsequently entered on the group register.
(2) Unless paragraph (3) applies, any party who is adversely affected by a judgment or order which is binding on them may seek permission to appeal the order.
(3) A party to a claim which was entered on the group register after a judgment or order which is binding on them was given or made may not –
(a) apply for the judgment or order to be set aside[(GL)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/glossary), varied or stayed[(GL)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/glossary); or
(b) appeal the judgment or order,
but may apply to the court for an order that the judgment or order is not binding on them.
(4) Unless the court orders otherwise, disclosure of any document relating to the GLO issues by a party to a claim on the group register is disclosure of that document to all parties to claims –
