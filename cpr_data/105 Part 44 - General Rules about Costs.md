(b) whether a party has succeeded on part of its case, even if that party has not been wholly successful; and
(c) any admissible offer to settle made by a party which is drawn to the court’s attention, and which is not an offer to which costs consequences under Part 36 apply.

[To the top](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#top)
### Basis of assessment

**44.3**
(1) Where the court is to assess the amount of costs (whether by summary or detailed assessment) it will assess those costs –
(a) on the standard basis; or
(b) on the indemnity basis,
but the court will not in either case allow costs which have been unreasonably incurred or are unreasonable in amount.
(Rule 44.5 sets out how the court decides the amount of costs payable under a contract.)
(2) Where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the standard basis, the court will –
(a) only allow costs which are proportionate to the matters in issue. Costs which are disproportionate in amount may be disallowed or reduced even if they were reasonably or necessarily incurred; and
(b) resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably and proportionately incurred or were reasonable and proportionate in amount in favour of the paying party.
(Factors which the court may take into account are set out in rule 44.4.)
(3) Where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the indemnity basis, the court will resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount in favour of the receiving party.
(4) Where –
(a) the court makes an order about costs without indicating the basis on which the costs are to be assessed; or
(b) the court makes an order for costs to be assessed on a basis other than the standard basis or the indemnity basis,
the costs will be assessed on the standard basis.
(5) Costs incurred are proportionate if they bear a reasonable relationship to –
(a) the sums in issue in the proceedings;
(b) the value of any non-monetary relief in issue in the proceedings;
(c) the complexity of the litigation;
(d) any additional work generated by the conduct of the paying party,

(f) any additional work undertaken or expense incurred due to the vulnerability of a party or any witness.
(6) Where the amount of a solicitor’s remuneration in respect of non-contentious business is regulated by any general orders made under the Solicitors Act 1974[4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#fn4), the amount of the costs to be allowed in respect of any such business which falls to be assessed by the court will be decided in accordance with those general orders rather than this rule and rule 44.4.
(7) Paragraphs (2)(a) and (5) do not apply in relation to –
(a) cases commenced before 1st April 2013; or
(b) costs incurred in respect of work done before 1st April 2013,
and in relation to such cases or costs, rule 44.4.(2)(a) as it was in force immediately before 1st April 2013 will apply instead.

(a) if it is assessing costs on the standard basis –
(i) proportionately and reasonably incurred; or
(ii) proportionate and reasonable in amount, or
(b) if it is assessing costs on the indemnity basis –
(i) unreasonably incurred; or
(ii) unreasonable in amount.

(3) The court will also have regard to –
(a) the conduct of all the parties, including in particular –
(i) conduct before, as well as during, the proceedings; and
(ii) the efforts made, if any, before and during the proceedings in order to try to resolve the dispute;
(b) the amount or value of any money or property involved;
(c) the importance of the matter to all the parties;
(d) the particular complexity of the matter or the difficulty or novelty of the questions raised;
(e) the skill, effort, specialised knowledge and responsibility involved;
(f) the time spent on the case;
(g) the place where and the circumstances in which work or any part of it was done; and

### Amount of costs where costs are payable under a contract

**44.5**
(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), where the court assesses (whether by summary or detailed assessment) costs which are payable by the paying party to the receiving party under the terms of a contract, the costs payable under those terms are, unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, to be presumed to be costs which –
(a) have been reasonably incurred; and
(b) are reasonable in amount,
and the court will assess them accordingly.
(2) The presumptions in paragraph (1) are rebuttable. Practice Direction 44 – General rules about costs sets out circumstances where the court may order otherwise.
(3) Paragraph (1) does not apply where the contract is between a solicitor and client.
[To the top](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#top)

unless any rule, practice direction or other enactment provides otherwise.
(Practice Direction 44 – General rules about costs sets out the factors which will affect the court’s decision under paragraph (1).)
(2) A party may recover the fixed costs specified in Part 45 in accordance with that Part.

(c) in either case, such other date as the court may specify.
(Part 47 sets out the procedure for detailed assessment of costs.)

### Legal representative’s duty to notify the party

the party’s legal representative must notify that party in writing of the costs order no later than 7 days after the legal representative receives notice of the order.

(2) Paragraph 1(b) does not apply where a Part 36 offer is accepted before the commencement of proceedings.
(3) Where such an order is deemed to be made in favour of a party with pro bono representation, that party may apply for an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act.
(4) Interest payable under section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838[5](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#fn5) or section 74 of the County Courts Act 1984[6](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#fn6) on the costs deemed to have been ordered under paragraph (1) will begin to run from the date on which the event which gave rise to the entitlement to costs occurred.

(a) an order granting permission to appeal;

(1) This Section applies to proceedings which include a claim for damages –
(a) for personal injuries;
(b) under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976[7](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#fn7); or

but does not apply to applications pursuant to section 33 of the Senior Courts Act 1981[9](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#fn9)or section 52 of the County Courts Act 1984[10](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#fn10) (applications for pre-action disclosure), or where rule 44.17 applies.

### Effect of qualified one-way costs shifting

**44.14**
(1) Subject to rules 44.15 and 44.16, orders for costs made against a claimant may be enforced without the permission of the court but only to the extent that the aggregate amount in money terms of such orders does not exceed the aggregate amount in money terms of any orders for, or agreements to pay or settle a claim for, damages, costs and interest made in favour of the claimant.
(2) For the purposes of this Section, orders for costs includes orders for costs deemed to have been made (either against the claimant or in favour of the claimant) as set out in rule 44.9.
(3) Orders for costs made against a claimant may only be enforced after the proceedings have been concluded and the costs have been assessed or agreed.
(4) Where enforcement is permitted against any order for costs made in favour of the claimant, rule 44.12 applies.
(5) An order for costs which is enforced only to the extent permitted by paragraph (1) shall not be treated as an unsatisfied or outstanding judgment for the purposes of any court record.

### Exceptions to qualified one-way costs shifting where permission not required

(c) the conduct of –
(i) the claimant; or
(ii) a person acting on the claimant’s behalf and with the claimant’s knowledge of such conduct,

(a) the proceedings include a claim which is made for the financial benefit of a person other than the claimant or a dependant within the meaning of section 1(3) of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (other than a claim in respect of the gratuitous provision of care, earnings paid by an employer or medical expenses); or
