## I — SCOPE OF THIS PRACTICE DIRECTION AND INTERPRETATION
## 1. Scope and application of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 and associated practice directions
1.1 This practice direction is made under rule 51.2 and applies to proceedings in the county court under Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 during the piloted commencement of that Part.
1.2 The Civil Procedure Rules 1998 and associated practice directions apply to proceedings to which this practice direction applies, but where a provision of the rules, practice directions or Form N244 (the specified court form for making an application, including an application for variation or discharge) conflict with this practice direction, this practice direction will take precedence.
1.3 During the operation of the pilot, Practice Direction 2B will apply as modified by paragraph 1.4.
1.4 In paragraph 8.1 of Practice Direction 2B, after sub-paragraph (c)(v), insert—
“(vi) Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021”.
1.5 This practice direction adopts the same paragraph numbering as Practice Direction 36ZG of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (the Family Practice Direction) where possible and, where relevant, corresponds with the Family Practice Direction. **If a paragraph of the Family Practice Direction is not applicable, the corresponding paragraph in this practice direction is blank.**
(Unlike in the family court, the county court can only make a Domestic Abuse Protection Order in limited circumstances – both the person to be protected and the person against whom the order is sought must already be parties to existing relevant proceedings (which do not have to be domestic abuse related).
## 2. Interpretation
2.1 In this practice direction—
“the 2021 Act” means the Domestic Abuse Act 2021;
“DAPO” means a domestic abuse protection order within the meaning of section 27 of the 2021 Act;
“P” means the person against whom a DAPO is sought or against whom the DAPO has been made;
“personally connected” has the meaning given by section 2 of the 2021 Act;
“person to be protected” means—
(a) the person who will be protected by the DAPO applied for or being considered by the court of its own initiative, if that order is made; or
(b) the person who is being protected by the DAPO, where a DAPO has been made;
“piloted commencement” means during any period when, pursuant to regulations made under section 90(7) to (9) of the 2021 Act, any provisions of Part 3 are in force only for a specified purpose, in relation to a specified area or for a specified period”;
“relevant occupant” means a person within the meaning of section 33(2) of the 2021 Act”;
“responsible person” means the person who is, or is to be, responsible for supervising or monitoring compliance with a positive requirement, or an electronic monitoring requirement, as the case may be;
“relevant proceedings” means proceedings within the meaning of section 31(7) and (8) of the 2021 Act.
## II — APPLICATION FOR A DAPO
## 3. Required information for DAPO application in relevant proceedings
3.1
3.2
3.3
3.4 An application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings must be made in accordance with paragraph 6 and set out the following information, if known—
(a) whether the contact details for the applicant are to be kept confidential;
(b)
(c) where the application relates to a property—
(i) the opinion of any relevant occupant about the making of an order; and
(ii) details of any mortgagee or landlord of the property; and
(d) details of—
(i) the times and location of where P normally works or attends an educational or religious establishment;
(ii) any other court order or injunction to which P is or was previously subject, including a DAPO made against P; and
(iii) any application for a court order or injunction in respect of P, including a DAPO, which has been refused by the court.
3.5 
3.6 An application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings must be served in accordance with paragraph 8.
3.7 This paragraph applies to an application for variation or discharge of a DAPO as it applies to an application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings.
(Section 32(2) of the 2021 Act provides that the first condition that a court must be satisfied of before making a DAPO is that on the balance of probabilities P has been abusive towards a person aged 16 or over to whom P is personally connected. Section 32(5) provides that a DAPO cannot be made against a person who is under the age of 18.)
(The person to be protected may only apply for a DAPO to the county court in existing relevant proceedings where they and P are parties to those proceedings and the court would have the power under section 31(7) of the 2021 Act to make a DAPO in those proceedings.)
(Section 28 of the 2021 Act enables an application for a DAPO to be made to the family court unless the person to be protected is applying in existing proceedings where they and P are parties and the court would have the power under section 31(2) to make a DAPO in those proceedings, in which case the application may be made to the family court or the Family Division of the High Court.)
(Section 28 of the 2021 Act enables the appropriate chief officer of police, as defined in that section, to apply for a DAPO by complaint to a magistrates’ court. In criminal proceedings, where P has been convicted or acquitted of an offence, the court dealing with the conviction or acquittal may make a DAPO against P (section 31(3) – (5) of the 2021 Act). And where the Crown Court in criminal proceedings allows a person’s appeal against a conviction for an offence, it may make a DAPO against the person (section 31(6) of the 2021 Act).) 
(Section 33(3) of the 2021 Act provides that the court may make a DAPO without the consent of the person to be protected.)
## 4. Application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings without notice to P
4.1 An application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings may be made without notice to P in accordance with paragraph 6.

6.2 The application may be made—

6.3 Subject to paragraph 6.5(a), if the application is made in writing it must be—

(ii) it must detail the information required by paragraph 3.4; or
(b) orally, the applicant must—
(i) explain to the court why notice has not been given; and
(ii) detail the information required by paragraph 3.4 to the court.
6.6 Where the application is made on notice it must be served in accordance with paragraph 8.
6.7 If the applicant has detailed that their contact details are to be kept confidential, the court must consider whether they should be kept confidential.
6.8 This paragraph applies to an application for any variation or discharge of a DAPO in existing relevant proceedings as it applies to an application for a DAPO in existing relevant proceedings.
(Section 34(1) of the 2021 Act enables the court to make a DAPO without notice to P where it is just and convenient to do so. Where the court makes a DAPO without notice to P, it must provide P with an opportunity to make representations about the order as soon as just and convenient at a hearing (section 34(4).)
## III — PARTIES
## 7. Parties
7.1 
7.2
7.3 Where the applicant is a child aged 16 or 17, who does not have a litigation friend, the court must consider if the child should have a litigation friend to conduct the proceedings on the child’s behalf.
7.4 A person, including the person to be protected, may make an application to the court for permission for a person to be removed, added or substituted as a party under Part 23.
7.5 
7.6 
7.7 
7.8 
7.9 This paragraph applies to proceedings for any variation or discharge of a DAPO as it applies to proceedings for a DAPO.
(Part 19 makes provision about the addition and substitution of parties and Part 21 makes general provision about the appointment of a litigation friend.)
## IV — SERVICE OF APPLICATIONS
## 8. Service of DAPO application in relevant proceedings
8.1 Where a DAPO application is made in relevant proceedings on notice, subject to paragraph 8.2, the applicant must serve a copy of the DAPO application and supporting statement, if made in writing, together with notice of the hearing on—

8.9 A certificate of service stating the date and time of service on each person served must be filed by—

12.3 Where the order relates to a property and details of any mortgagee or landlord of the property were set out in the DAPO application pursuant to paragraph 3.4(c)(ii), the court may direct that a hearing be held to consider any representations made by the mortgagee or landlord.

## VI — PROVISIONS IMPOSED BY A DAPO
## 13. General
13.1 This paragraph applies where the court makes or varies a DAPO—
(a) on application; or
(b) of its own initiative.
13.2 The court must—
(a) have regard to the terms of a DAPO already made against P (‘the previous order’), if any; 
(b) where a previous order has been made, consider whether the DAPO (‘the new order’) should specify that it takes effect on the previous order ceasing to have effect; and
(c) tell P about the notification requirements that P must comply with under sections 41 and 42 of the 2021 Act.
13.3 A DAPO must set out—
(a) the requirements which are to be imposed on P; and
(b) the duration—
(i) of each requirement imposed on P; and
(ii) for which the order is to have effect.
(Section 35(1) of the 2021 Act specifies that ‘requirement’ includes any prohibition or restriction.)
(Section 36(1) of the 2021 Act provides that requirements imposed on P by a DAPO must not, as far as practicable, conflict with P’s religious beliefs, interfere with the times at which P normally works or attends an educational establishment or conflict with the requirements of any other court order or injunction to which P is subject.)
(Sections 41 and 42 of the 2021 Act impose mandatory notification requirements on P. Within 3 days of a DAPO being made, P must notify the police of their name and home address. And P must notify the police of any changes to such details within 3 days of it happening.)
## 14. Including a positive requirement in a DAPO
14.1 This paragraph does not apply in relation to electronic monitoring requirements (in relation to which paragraph 15 makes provision).
14.2 The court may not include in a DAPO a requirement that P do something (a “positive requirement”), including on variation of a DAPO, until it has received evidence about the suitability and enforceability of the proposed positive requirement under section 36(3) of the 2021 Act, from the person who is to be responsible for supervising compliance with the requirement.
14.3 The evidence under paragraph 14.2 may be given orally or in writing.
14.4 Where the evidence under paragraph 14.2—
(a) has been taken, the court may make a DAPO which includes the positive requirement; or
(b) has not been taken, the court may—
(i) make an interim DAPO which does not include the positive requirement; and
(ii) give directions for the taking of the evidence to determine whether to include the positive requirement in the DAPO once the evidence has been taken.
14.5 Any directions given by the court under paragraph 14.4(b)(ii) must specify the time within which the person who is to be responsible for supervising compliance is to submit the evidence to the court.
14.6 Where the court makes a DAPO that includes a positive requirement, it must tell P about the obligations that P must comply with under section 36(7) of the 2021 Act.
14.7 Where the DAPO includes a positive requirement, the court officer must—
(a) inform the responsible person of—
(i) P’s name, address and, if available, telephone number; and
(ii) details of the requirement to be supervised by the responsible person;
(b) inform P of the responsible person’s identity and the means by which the responsible person may be contacted; and
(c) notify the responsible person of any variation or discharge of the positive requirement.
## 15. Imposing an electronic monitoring requirement
15.1This paragraph applies where the court imposes an electronic monitoring requirement, where available, in a DAPO.
15.2 The court may not impose an electronic monitoring requirement in a DAPO, including on variation of a DAPO—

(b) if the person’s consent required under section 37(3) of the 2021 Act has not been obtained.
15.3 Where the requirements of paragraph 15.2 are—
(a) satisfied, the court may make a DAPO which imposes an electronic monitoring requirement; or
(b) not satisfied, the court may—
(i) make an interim DAPO which does not impose the electronic monitoring requirement; and
(ii) give directions so that the requirements of paragraph 15.2 are met.
15.4 Where the court makes a DAPO that imposes an electronic monitoring requirement, it must tell P—
(a) about the obligations that P must comply with under sections 36(7) and 37(8) of the 2021 Act; and
(b) that if P intends to change or changes home address, P must apply to the court for a variation of the DAPO.
15.5 Where the DAPO imposes an electronic monitoring requirement, the court officer must—
(a) inform the responsible person of—
(i) P’s name, address and, if available, telephone number;
(ii) details of the requirement to be monitored by the responsible person; and
(iii) details of the place at which P’s presence must be monitored and the period or periods during which P’s presence at that place must be monitored by the responsible person;
(b) inform P of the responsible person’s identity and the means by which the responsible person may be contacted; and
(c) notify the responsible person of any variation or discharge of the electronic monitoring requirement.
## 16. DAPOs made by the court in existing relevant proceedings
16.1 Where the county court makes a DAPO of its own initiative under section 31(7) of the 2021 Act, it must—
(a) have regard to the requirements of paragraph 13.2; and
(b) set out in the order—
(i) a summary of its reasons for making the order;
(ii) the names of the persons who are to be served with the order; and
(iii) the requirements of paragraph 13.3.
16.2 The court may order service of the order (and any other documents directed by the court) on—
