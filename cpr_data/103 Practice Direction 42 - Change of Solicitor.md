### Solicitor acting for a party

**1.1** Rule 42.1 states that where the address for service of a party is the business address[1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part42/pd_part42#fn1) of that party’s solicitor, the solicitor will be considered to be acting for that party until the provisions of Part 42 have been complied with.

**1.2** Subject to rule 42.2(6) (where the certificate of a LSC funded client or assisted person is revoked or discharged), where a party has changed his solicitor or intends to act in person, the former solicitor will be considered to be the party’s solicitor unless or until;
(1) a notice of the change is
(a) filed with the court[2](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part42/pd_part42#fn2), and
(b) served on every other party[3](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part42/pd_part42#fn3), or
(2) the court makes an order under rule 42.3 and the order is served on every other party[4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part42/pd_part42#fn4).
The notice should not be filed until every other party has been served.

**1.3** A solicitor appointed to represent a party only as an advocate at a hearing will not be considered to be acting for that party within the meaning of Part 42.

### Notice of change of solicitor

**2.1** Rule 42.2(1) sets out the circumstances following which a notice of the change must be filed and served.

**2.2** A notice of the change giving the last known address of the former assisted person must also be filed and served on every party where, under rule 42.2(6):
(1) the certificate of a LSC funded client or assisted person is revoked or discharged,
(2) the solicitor who acted for that person ceased to act on determination of his retainer under regulation 83 of those Regulations, and
(3) the LSC funded client or the assisted person wishes either to act in person or appoint another solicitor to act on his behalf.

**2.3** In addition, where a party or solicitor changes his address for service, a notice of that change should be filed and served on every party.

**2.4** A party who, having conducted a claim by a solicitor, intends to act in person must give in the notice an address for service that is within the United Kingdom[5](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part42/pd_part42#fn5).

**2.5** Subject to paragraph 2.7A, practice form N434 should be used to give notice of any change. The notice should be filed in the court office in which the claim is proceeding.

**2.6** Omitted

**2.7** Subject to paragraph 2.7A, where the claim is the subject of an appeal to the Court of Appeal, the notice should also be filed in the Civil Appeals Office.

**2.7A** If notice of change is being given by a solicitor who has a MyHMCTS account, and that solicitor will be conducting the claim to which the notice of change relates through their MyHMCTS account, the solicitor should not use practice form N434, but instead should file notice of change with the court using MyHMCTS.
