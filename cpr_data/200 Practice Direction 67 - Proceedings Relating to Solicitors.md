### Proceedings in the costs office

**2.1** Where a claim to which this practice direction applies is made by Part 8 claim form in the High Court in London –
(1) if the claim is of a type referred to in paragraphs 1(1) to (5), it must be issued in the Costs Office;
(2) in any other case, the claim may be issued in the Costs Office.

**2.2** A claim which is made by Part 8 claim form in a district registry or by Part 23 application notice in existing High Court proceedings may be referred to the Costs Office.

**2.2A** Where a claim under section 70 or 71 of the Act is made by Part 8 claim form in the Costs Office, the court will fix a date for a hearing at which directions will be given, unless the claim is not contested, when an order for detailed assessment will be made. Evidence need not be filed or served by either party before that hearing.

**2.3** ‘Costs Office’ has the same meaning as set out in rule 44.1(1).

### Jurisdiction and allocation of claims between judiciary

**3.1** Rule 67.3(3) makes provision about jurisdiction to determine claims under Part III of the Act.

**3.3** Paragraph 1 of Practice Direction 23A sets out the circumstances in which a matter may be referred to a judge.
