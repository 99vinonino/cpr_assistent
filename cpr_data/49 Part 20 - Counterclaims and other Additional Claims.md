### Scope and interpretation

**20.2**
(1) This Part applies to –
(a) a counterclaim by a defendant against the claimant or against the claimant and some other person;
(b) an additional claim by a defendant against any person (whether or not already a party) for contribution or indemnity or some other remedy; and
(c) where an additional claim has been made against a person who is not already a party, any additional claim made by that person against any other person (whether or not already a party).
(2) In these Rules –
(a) ‘additional claim’ means any claim other than the claim by the claimant against the defendant; and
(b) unless the context requires otherwise, references to a claimant or defendant include a party bringing or defending an additional claim.

### Application of these Rules to additional claims

(b) rule 16.3(5) (statement of value where claim to be issued in the High Court); and
(c) Part 26 (case management – preliminary stage).
(3) Part 12 (default judgment) applies to a counterclaim but not to other additional claims.
(4) Part 14 (admissions) applies to a counterclaim, but only rules 14.2(1), (4) and (5) and 14.4(1) apply to other additional claims.
