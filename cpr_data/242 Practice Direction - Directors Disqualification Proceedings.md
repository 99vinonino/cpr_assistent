(1) file in court any further affidavit or report in reply he wishes the court to take into consideration; and

If serving by first class post on the defendant’s last known address the day of service shall, unless the contrary is shown, be deemed to be the 7th day next following that on which the claim form was posted. Otherwise, Sections I and II of CPR Part 6 apply. Attention is drawn to CPR r 6.14(2) regarding a certificate of service of the claim form.

**27.6** Section IV of CPR Part 6 shall not apply. In any disqualification proceedings where a claim form or other document is required to be served on any person who is not in England and Wales, the court may order service on him to be effected within such time and in such manner as it thinks fit, may require such proof of service as it thinks fit, and may give such directions as to acknowledgment of service as it thinks fit.

**27.7** The claim form served on the defendant shall be accompanied by an acknowledgment of service in the form annexed hereto.

### 28. Acknowledgment of service

**28.1** The defendant shall:
(1) file an acknowledgment of service in the relevant practice form not more than 14 days after service of the claim form; and
(2) serve a copy of the acknowledgment of service on the claimant and any other party.

**28.2** Where the defendant has failed to file an acknowledgment of service and the time period for doing so has expired, the defendant may nevertheless attend the hearing of the application and take part in the hearing as provided for by section 8A(2) or (2A) of the Act. However, this is without prejudice to the Court’s case management powers and its powers to make costs orders.
