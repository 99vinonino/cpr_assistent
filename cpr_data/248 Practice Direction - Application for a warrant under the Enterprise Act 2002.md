## Notice of the Powers to search premises and of the rights of occupiers under section 194 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (‘the Act’)
### Subject matter and powers
[In this notice, references to an officer or officers of the OFT’ shall be taken to include any competent person authorised by the OFT under section 195(1) of the Act to exercise on its behalf all or any of the powers conferred by section 194 of the Act.] Officers of the Office of Fair Trading (‘the OFT’) have been authorised under Warrant to enter and search the premises identified in the Warrant in connection with an investigation under the Act. OFT officers can be accompanied by one or more named individuals authorised to assist them to execute the warrant under section 194(4) of the Act. The subject matter of this investigation is set out in paragraph 2 of the Warrant. The officers and any accompanying persons will not elaborate on this.
Paragraph 3 of the Warrant sets out the powers of the named officer[1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/appforwarrant_comp_act2002#f1001) and other officers and any accompanying persons under section 194 of the Act for the purposes of the present investigation. On entering the premises, the named officer will, as a matter of practice, produce evidence of his identity when producing the Warrant, and identify and introduce all other officers and any accompanying persons, unless he has reasonable grounds for believing that alerting the occupier or any other person entitled to grant access would frustrate the object of the search or endanger any officers or accompanying persons.
Officers of the OFT and any accompanying persons shall have regard to the provisions of Code B of the Code of Practice under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, including in Scotland. A copy of Code B of the Codes of Practice will be made available on request.
Reasonable and proportionate force may be used to enter premises if the named officer in charge of the search is satisfied that premises are those specified in the warrant and the occupier or any other person entitled to grant access has refused entry or it is impossible to communicate with the occupier or any other person entitled to grant access. If the occupier is not present, a copy of the warrant and of the notice of the powers to search premises and the rights of occupiers shall be left in a prominent place on the premises, recording the date and time of the search and the name of the named officer.
If premises have been entered by force, before leaving the named officer must make sure that they are secure either by arranging for the occupier or the occupier’s representative to be present or by any other appropriate means.
Unless the Court has ordered otherwise, the initial production of the Warrant and entry to premises must take place at a reasonable hour unless this might frustrate the purpose of the search; and, once officers and any accompanying persons have entered premises under the authority of the Warrant, they may remain on the premises or re-enter the premises to continue executing the Warrant.
The named officer shall also provide the occupier with this Notice of the powers to search premises and the rights of occupiers.
OFT officers also have the power in accordance with section 50 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 to seize material where it is not reasonably practicable, while on the premises, to determine the extent to which it may be seized, if at all, or for the seizable material to be separated from the non-seizable material in which it is comprised. Where this power is to be exercised, the occupier will be given a Notice which sets out the grounds for the exercise of the power and the rights of persons who have an interest in the property to be seized pursuant to the power.
### Access to legal advice
When executing a warrant OFT officers are not required to wait for an occupier or other person’s legal adviser to be present before commencing the search.
However, generally the OFT officers will wait for a legal adviser before commencing a search provided the search is not unreasonably delayed. Where the OFT officers do wait for the legal adviser’s arrival, they will wait on the premises and all persons on the premises will be required to adhere to appropriate instructions to ensure that material on the premises, or on other premises, which may be relevant to the investigation, is not interfered or tampered with.
Furthermore, in cases where the OFT has commenced the search without waiting for a legal adviser to arrive, the OFT would avoid removing any material from the premises until the person’s legal adviser has arrived and had the opportunity to make representations. This is provided that the conclusion of the search is not unreasonably delayed.
### Witness to the search
A friend, neighbour or other person will be allowed to witness the search if the occupier wishes unless the named officer in charge of the search has reasonable grounds for believing that the presence of such person would unreasonably delay the investigation or endanger officers or other people.
A record of the action taken, including the grounds for refusing a request from the occupier to have a witness to the search, will be made on the premises search record.
### Protection against self-incrimination
The OFT has the power to require any person at the premises to provide an explanation of any document appearing to be of the relevant kind or to state, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, where it may be found. This power is used to enable the OFT to direct its search efficiently and effectively.
It should be noted that, any statement made by a person in response to any such requirement imposed by the named officer or other officers or accompanying persons in exercise of their powers under paragraph 3(c) of the Warrant (the ‘earlier statement’), may only be used in evidence against that person in the following circumstances.
On a prosecution for an offence under section 201(2) of the Act
Where that person has knowingly or recklessly made a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular in response to that requirement.
On a prosecution for some other offence
Where he makes a statement inconsistent with the earlier statement provided evidence relating to the earlier statement is adduced or a question relating to it is asked by him or on his behalf in that prosecution[2](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/appforwarrant_comp_act2002#f1002).
### Privileged communications
The powers under section 194 of the Act in relation to documents and information (set out in paragraph 3(b) onwards in the Warrant) do not apply to communications benefiting from legal professional privilege (‘privilege’). A person may not be required to disclose any information or produce any document which he would be entitled to refuse to disclose or produce on grounds of privilege in proceedings in the High Court. However, a lawyer may be required to provide the name and address of his client as part of an investigation being conducted under the powers in the Act. Privilege does not apply to communications made with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose (whether the lawyer is acting unwittingly or culpably).
The Act also provides a safeguard in respect of confidential banking information. A person may not be required to disclose any information or produce any document in respect of which he owes an obligation of confidence by virtue of carrying on any banking business, unless the person to whom the obligation of confidence is owed consents to the disclosure or production or the OFT has authorised the making of the requirement.
If you consider that a document or information is subject to privilege, you should provide the named officer or other officer or accompanying person with a sufficient explanation such as to demonstrate to his satisfaction that the document or information, or parts of it, for which privilege is claimed, fulfil the conditions for it being privileged.
If no agreement is reached during the search as to whether the conditions for privilege have been made out in relation to particular documents or information, the named officer will request that the documents or information are placed in a sealed opaque bag in his presence. The named officer will then discuss with you appropriate arrangements for the safe-keeping of the documents or information by the OFT pending resolution of the issue of privilege.
### Listing of items
Unless it is impracticable in all the circumstances, items will not be removed from the premises by the named officer or other officers or accompanying persons until a list has been prepared by the named officer (or other officers or accompanying persons) of all the items to be removed, a copy of the list has been supplied to you, and you have been given a reasonable opportunity to check that the list relates to all the items concerned, and only to those items.
### Retention and copying of items
Items seized during the search will be retained by the OFT only for as long as is necessary in all the circumstances. For example, material seized may be retained if it will be needed –
  1. for use in evidence in a criminal trial;
  2. to satisfy the OFT’s criminal disclosure obligations; or
  3. so that it may be subjected to forensic examination.


Material may also be retained under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.
On request, the OFT will, where practicable, provide a copy of such material to the person from whom the material was seized as soon as reasonably practicable.
### Confidentiality
You should note that, subject to the safeguards in relation to self-incrimination and communications subject to privilege, you are **not** entitled to withhold a document or information by claiming that it is confidential.
However, section 237 of the Act imposes limits on the disclosure of information that relates to the affairs of any individual or any business which has been obtained by the OFT as a result of using its powers of investigation under the Act, subject to certain exceptions. Those exceptions include the right of the OFT to disclose information for the purpose of facilitating the exercise by the OFT of its statutory function and the investigation of any criminal offence in any part of the UK. The relevant provisions are in Part 9 of the Act.
### Application to vary or discharge the Warrant
You are entitled to apply to the Court to vary or discharge the Warrant. If you intend to make such an application, you must first inform the named officer. An application to stop the Warrant from being executed must be made immediately upon it being served.
The application must be made to the judge who issued the Warrant, or if he is not available, to another judge of the Chancery Division.
If you are making an immediate application to stop the Warrant from being executed, the named officer will delay starting or continuing a search of the premises for a reasonable period (not exceeding two hours) while you make your application, provided that you –
  1. permit the named officer and other officers [and other accompanying persons] to enter and remain on the premises;
  2. keep the named officer informed of the steps you are taking in relation to the application;
  3. provide the named officer with contact details of the solicitor, if any, who is in receipt of your formal instructions in relation to an application to stop the Warrant being executed; and
  4. comply with any other conditions that the named officer imposes.


Examples of conditions that the named officer may impose pursuant to (4) above include –
  1. that you do not disturb or move any document or information that is the subject of the Warrant; and/or
  2. you do not tell anyone other than your legal adviser about the Warrant or the investigation.


### Application under section 59 Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001
Your attention is drawn to section 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which makes provision about applications relating to property seized in the exercise of the powers conferred by (among other provisions) section 194(2) of the Act.
An application under section 59 should be made to a judge of the Crown Court.
## Footnotes
