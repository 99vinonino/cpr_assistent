### Transfer within the County Court and the High Court

**30.2**
(1) In the County Court, a court may order that proceedings, or any part of them (such as a counterclaim or an application made in the proceedings), may be transferred to another County Court hearing centre if it is satisfied that –
(a) an order should be made having regard to the criteria in rule 30.3; or
(b) proceedings for –
(i) the detailed assessment of costs; or
(ii) the enforcement of a judgment or order,
could be more conveniently or fairly taken elsewhere.
(2) If proceedings have been started in the wrong county court, a judge of the county court may order that the proceedings –
(a) be transferred to the county court in which they ought to have been started;
(b) continue in the county court in which they have been started; or
(c) be struck out.
(3) An application for an order under paragraph (1) or (2) must be made to the County Court hearing centre where the claim is proceeding.
(4) The High Court may, having regard to the criteria in rule 30.3, order proceedings in the Royal Courts of Justice or a district registry, or any part of such proceedings (such as a counterclaim or an application made in the proceedings), to be transferred –
(a) from the Royal Courts of Justice to a district registry; or
(b) from a district registry to the Royal Courts of Justice or to another district registry.
(5) A district registry may order proceedings before it for the detailed assessment of costs to be transferred to another district registry if it is satisfied that the proceedings could be more conveniently or fairly taken in that other district registry.
(6) An application for an order under paragraph (4) or (5) must, if the claim is proceeding in a district registry, be made to that registry.
(7) Where some enactment, other than these Rules, requires proceedings to be started by sending, or making, the claim or application to a particular County Court hearing centre, paragraph (1) does not give the court power to order proceedings to be transferred elsewhere.
(8) Probate proceedings may only be transferred under paragraph (4) to the Chancery Division at the Royal Courts of Justice or to one of the Chancery district registries.

### Criteria for a transfer order

**30.3**
(1) Paragraph (2) sets out the matters to which the court must have regard when considering whether to make an order under –
(a) section 40(2), 41(1) or 42(2) of the County Courts Act 1984[1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part30#fn1)(transfer between the High Court and a county court);

(2) The matters to which the court must have regard include –
(a) the financial value of the claim and the amount in dispute, if different;
(b) whether it would be more convenient or fair for hearings (including the trial) to be held in some other court;
(c) the availability of a judge specialising in the type of claim in question and in particular the availability of a specialist judge sitting in an appropriate regional specialist court;
(d) whether the facts, legal issues, remedies or procedures involved are simple or complex;
(e) the importance of the outcome of the claim to the public in general;
(f) the facilities available to the court at which the claim is being dealt with, particularly in relation to –
(i) any disabilities of a party or potential witness;
(ii) any special measures needed for potential witnesses; or
(iii) security;
(g) whether the making of a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 has arisen or may arise;

(3) Where in proceedings in the County Court the court considers that there is a real possibility that a party would in the course of the proceedings be required to disclose material the disclosure of which would be damaging to the interests of national security, the court must transfer the proceedings to the High Court.
