## Introduction

**1.1** In addition to any relevant definitions in Part 56, particularly those in rule 56.5, which all apply to this practice direction in any event, terms defined in the 2016 Act have the same meaning in this practice direction.

**1.2** This practice direction makes provision for the bringing of Renting Homes (Wales) claims. Where a claim for possession, the making of a prohibited conduct standard contract order, or a claim for damages for disrepair is made at the commencement of proceedings Section III of Part 56 does not apply and the procedure for those particular claims should be followed.
## Starting the claim

**2.1**(1) “Permission to make an out of time application” means an application for permission to make an application out of time under the following provisions of the 2016 Act –
(a)section 14(4);
(b)paragraph 16(4) of Schedule 2;
(c)paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 4; or
(d)paragraph 6(4) of Schedule 7.
(2) Where permission to make an out of time application is sought before the substantive application is made, it should be sought by written request.
(3) Where permission to make an out of time application is sought at the same time as the substantive application is made it should be sought as part of substantive claim using the procedure appropriate for that claim.

**2.2** Renting Homes (Wales) claims should normally be brought in the county court. Only exceptional circumstances justify starting a claim in the High Court even if the High Court has jurisdiction.

**2.3** If a claimant starts a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the County Court, the court will normally either strike the claim out or transfer it to the County Court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay and the court will normally disallow the costs of starting the claim in the High Court and of any transfer.

**2.4** Circumstances which may, in an appropriate case, justify starting a claim in the High Court are if –
(a) there are complicated disputes of fact; or
(b) there are points of law of general importance.

**2.5** The value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances, but these factors alone will not normally justify starting the claim in the High Court.

**2.6** A Renting Homes (Wales) claim started in the High Court must be brought in the Chancery Division.
## Contents of the claim form in all cases

**3.1** The claim form must contain details of –
(a )the dwelling to which the claim relates;
(b) the particulars of the current occupation contract (including date, parties and duration) insofar as the claimant is able to confirm the same;
(c) any notice relevant to the claim;
(d) the provisions of the 2016 Act under which the claim is brought.
