### 61.1 – Scope

**1.1** Practice Direction 58 also applies to Admiralty claims except where it is inconsistent with Part 61 or this practice direction.

**1.2** Practice Direction 57AC (Witness Evidence at Trial) applies to witness statements for use at trials in admiralty claims (including claims in rem, collision claims, and limitation claims) in the Admiralty Court, notwithstanding that such claims are not proceedings under CPR Part 7 or Part 8. It applies to proceedings in the Admiralty Court whenever begun, but only to trial witness statements signed on or after 1 October 2021.
(Rule 61.1(2) defines an ‘admiralty claim’ as a claim within the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court as set out in section 20 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.)”
### Case management

**2.1** After a claim form is issued the Registrar will issue a direction in writing stating –
(1) whether the claim will remain in the Admiralty Court or be transferred to another court; and
(2) if the claim remains in the Admiralty Court –
(a) whether it will be dealt with by –
(i) the Admiralty Judge; or
(ii) the Registrar; and
(b) whether the trial will be in London or elsewhere.

**2.2** In making these directions the Registrar will have regard to –
(1) the nature of the issues and the sums in dispute; and
(2) the criteria set in rule 26.13 so far as they are applicable.

**2.3** Where the Registrar directs that the claim will be dealt with by the Admiralty Judge, case management directions will be given and any case management conference or pre-trial review will be heard by the Admiralty Judge.

**2.4** Where it is directed that a claim is to be dealt with by the Registrar, it is the Registrar who will give directions, conduct any case management conference and any pre-trial review, and try the claim.

**2.5** Appeals from all decisions and judgments of the Registrar are to the Admiralty Judge, unless otherwise ordered (and subject to article 4(1)(a) of the Access to Justice 1999 (Destination of Appeals) Order 2016, S.I. 2016 No. 917).

**2.6** A personal injury or fatal accident claim must be commenced in the Admiralty Court if it is made in rem or if it arises out of a collision; see CPR rules 61.2(1)(a)(i) and (ii).

**2.7** Personal injury and fatal accident claims falling within section 20(2)(f) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 made in personam, if commenced in the High Court, may be commenced in the Admiralty Court. Under its tort and contract jurisdiction and its jurisdiction to determine claims for sums recoverable under statute conferred by sections 15 and 16 of the County Courts Act 1984 respectively, such claims may also be commenced in the County Court.

**2.8** Claims within paragraph 2.7 should not be commenced in the Admiralty Court unless they require or would benefit from the specialist knowledge and experience of that court. That is likely to include personal injury claims—
(a) which involve questions of navigation, seamanship, boat or ship-handling skills and/or acts or omissions relating to sea state;
(b) which arise out of the shipwreck, capsizing or stranding of the ship, or explosion or fire in the ship;
(c) which are employer’s liability claims relating to or concerning equipment or working practices peculiar to a ship;
(d) which raise difficult or novel questions of private international law or of the interpretation of the Athens Convention.
Other personal injury claims not raising any such issues should ordinarily be commenced in the County Court or the Central Office of the King’s Bench Division of the High Court.

**2.9** Where a personal injury or fatal accident claim in personam has been commenced in the Admiralty Court but, at any stage, it appears that it may be more efficiently or proportionately tried in another court, then it may be transferred to that other court on the application of any party or of the court’s own motion (see CPR rule 61.2(3)). The County Court has similar powers under CPR rule 30.3, including the power to transfer to the Admiralty Court.
### 61.3 – Claims in rem

**3.1** A claim form in rem must be in Form [ADM1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part61/pd_part61?a=18412).

**3.2** The claimant in a claim in rem may be named or may be described, but if not named in the claim form must identify himself by name if requested to do so by any other party.

**3.3** The defendant must be described in the claim form.

**3.4** The acknowledgment of service must be in Form [ADM2](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part61/pd_part61?a=18412). The person who acknowledges service must identify himself by name.

**3.5** The period for acknowledging service under rule 61.3(4) applies irrespective of whether the claim form contains particulars of claim.

**3.6** A claim form in rem may be served in the following ways:
(1) on the property against which the claim is brought by fixing a copy of the claim form –
(a) on the outside of the property in a position which may reasonably be expected to be seen; or
(b) where the property is freight, either –
(i) on the cargo in respect of which the freight was earned; or
(ii) on the ship on which the cargo was carried;
(2) if the property to be served is in the custody of a person who will not permit access to it, by leaving a copy of the claim form with that person;
(3) where the property has been sold by the Marshal, by filing the claim form at the court;
(4) where there is a notice against arrest, on the person named in the notice as being authorised to accept service;
(5) on any solicitor authorised to accept service;
(6) in accordance with any agreement providing for service of proceedings; or
(7) in any other manner as the court may direct under rule 6.15 provided that the property against which the claim is brought or part of it is within the jurisdiction of the court.

**3.7** In claims where the property –
(1) is to be arrested; or
(2) is already under arrest in current proceedings,
the Marshal will serve the in rem claim form if the claimant requests the court to do so.

**3.8** In all other cases in rem claim forms must be served by the claimant.

**3.9** Where the defendants are described and not named on the claim form (for example as ‘the Owners of the Ship X’), any acknowledgment of service in addition to stating that description must also state the full names of the persons acknowledging service and the nature of their ownership.

**3.10** After the acknowledgment of service has been filed, the claim will follow the procedure applicable to a claim proceeding in the Commercial list except that the claimant is allowed 75 days to serve the particulars of claim.

**3.11** A defendant who files an acknowledgment of service to an in rem claim does not lose any right he may have to dispute the jurisdiction of the court (see rule 10.1(3)(b) and Part 11).

**3.12** Any person who pays the prescribed fee may, during office hours, search for, inspect and take a copy of any claim form in rem whether or not it has been served.
### 61.3A – Claims in personam
3A.1 This section applies to Admiralty claims in personam (defined in rule 61.1(2)(bc) as an admiralty claim other than a claim in rem). Subject to the provisions of Part 61 and this practice direction relating to limitation claims and to collision claims, the following provisions apply to such claims.
3A.2 All such claims will proceed in accordance with Part 58 (Commercial Court).
3A.3 The claim form must be in Form ADM1A and must be served by the claimant.
3A.4 The claimant may be named or may be described, but if not named in the claim form must identify themselves by name if requested to do so by any other party.

#### Fast track collision claims

**4.7** In any collision claim where electronic track data has been disclosed by one or more parties as being in its control in accordance with rule 61.4(4A)—
(1) the court will seek to adopt fast track procedures for the determination of issues of liability as part of its duty actively to manage cases in accordance with the overriding objective, which may include directions—

(3) a combination of (1) and (2).

**10.10** Where a limitation fund is established by making a payment into court, the sum paid in must be –

**10.13A** Where a claimant wishes to establish a limitation fund (in whole or in part) by providing security, the claimant must apply to the court for an order approving the security. The application may be made on paper and without notice, but the applicant should first seek to agree the provider, form, nature, and terms of the proposed security with any named defendant and any interested party before making the application (unless the circumstances of the case make that impracticable).

**10.13B** An application under paragraph 10.13A must be –

If the security is expressed in sterling, the amount of the security shall be the same as if the fund were being constituted by payment in to court and paragraphs 10.10 and 10.11(1) above shall apply in an equivalent sense.

**10.13E** The claimant must give notice in writing to every named defendant and any interested party whose address is known of any court-approved security lodged at court, specifying—

(1) any person (whether a defendant, an interested party or another), who was not given notice of the claimant’s application under paragraph 10.13A; or
(2) any person (whether a defendant, an interested party or another) if circumstances relevant to the adequacy of the security have changed since it was approved by the court.

**10.13G** An application under paragraph 10.13F(1) must be –
(1) made on notice to the provider of the security, all claimants, all named defendants, and all interested parties (whose addresses are known);
(2) supported by evidence setting out the reasons why the court’s approval of the security should be set aside; and
