### Preamble

**1** In this direction “Right to Buy Claim” means a claim made and/or brought by any person or persons claiming damages and/or equitable compensation against a solicitor or firm of solicitors (or former solicitor or firm of solicitors) who acted for the claimant or claimants on the exercise of the right to buy their council houses under the Housing Act 1985 and who did so having allegedly been advised by a mortgage broker and/or introducer where such claim is not concerned solely with an alleged defect in title or an alleged error in conveyancing.
