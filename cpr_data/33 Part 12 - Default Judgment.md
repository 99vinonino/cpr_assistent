### Conditions to be satisfied

**12.3**
(1) The claimant may obtain judgment in default of an acknowledgment of service only if at the date on which judgment is entered—

(b) in a counterclaim made under rule 20.4, where at the date on which judgment is entered a defence has not been filed,
and, in either case, the relevant time limit for doing so has expired.
(Rule 20.4 makes general provision for a defendant’s counterclaim against a claimant, and rule 20.4(3) provides that Part 10 (acknowledgement of service) does not apply to a counterclaim made under that rule.)
(3) The claimant may not obtain a default judgment if at the time the court is considering the issue—
(a) the defendant has applied—
(i) to have the claimant’s statement of case struck out under rule 3.4; or

and, in either case, that application has not been dealt with;

(Part 14 sets out the procedure where a defendant admits a money claim and asks for time to pay.)
(Rule 6.17 provides that, where the claim form is served by the claimant, the claimant may not obtain default judgment unless a certificate of service has been filed.)
