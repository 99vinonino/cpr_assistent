## SECTION I – GENERAL RULES
### 55.3 – STARTING THE CLAIM

**1.1**
(1) Except where the County Court does not have jurisdiction, possession claims should normally be brought in the County Court. Only exceptional circumstances justify starting a claim in the High Court.
(2) In the County Court, the claim will be issued by the County Court hearing centre where the claim is made, but will then be sent to the County Court hearing centre which serves the address where the land is situated. A claimant should consider the potential delay which may result if a claim is not made at the appropriate hearing centre in the first instance.

**1.2** If a claimant starts a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the County Court, the court will normally either strike the claim out or transfer it to the County Court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay and the court will normally disallow the costs of starting the claim in the High Court and of any transfer.

**1.3** Circumstances which may, in an appropriate case, justify starting a claim in the High Court are if –
(1) there are complicated disputes of fact;
(2) there are points of law of general importance; or
(3) the claim is against trespassers and there is a substantial risk of public disturbance or of serious harm to persons or property which properly require immediate determination.

**1.4** The value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances, but these factors alone will not normally justify starting the claim in the High Court.

**1.5** The claimant must use the appropriate claim form and particulars of claim form. The defence must be in form [N11](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part55/pd_part55a?a=18412), [N11B](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part55/pd_part55a?a=18412), [N11M](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part55/pd_part55a?a=18412) or [N11R](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part55/pd_part55a?a=18412), as appropriate.

**1.6** High Court claims for the possession of land subject to a mortgage will be assigned to the Chancery Division.

**1.7** A claim which is not a possession claim may be brought under the procedure set out in Section I of Part 55 if it is started in the same claim form as a possession claim which, by virtue of rule 55.2(1) must be brought in accordance with that Section.
(Rule 7.3 provides that a claimant may use a single claim form to start all claims which can be conveniently disposed of in the same proceedings)

**1.8** For example a claim under paragraphs 4, 5 or 6 of Part I of Schedule 1 to the Mobile Homes Act 1983 may be brought using the procedure set out in Section I of Part 55 if the claim is started in the same claim form as a claim enforcing the rights referred to in section 3(1)(b) of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (which, by virtue of rule 55.2(1) must be brought under Section I of Part 55).

**1.9** Where the claim form includes a demotion claim, the claim must be started in the County Court for the district in which the land is situated.
### 55.4 – PARTICULARS OF CLAIM

**2.1** In a possession claim the particulars of claim must:
(1) identify the land to which the claim relates;

**3.1** The court may exercise its powers under rules 3.1(2)(a) and (b) to shorten the time periods set out in rules 55.5(2) and (3).

**3.2** Particular consideration should be given to the exercise of this power if:
(1) the defendant, or a person for whom the defendant is responsible, has assaulted or threatened to assault:
(a) the claimant;
(b) a member of the claimant’s staff; or
(c) another resident in the locality;
(2) there are reasonable grounds for fearing such an assault; or
(3) the defendant, or a person for whom the defendant is responsible, has caused serious damage or threatened to cause serious damage to the property or to the home or property of another resident in the locality.

**3.3** Where paragraph 3.2 applies but the case cannot be determined at the first hearing fixed under rule 55.5, the court will consider what steps are needed to finally determine the case as quickly as reasonably practicable.
### 55.6 – SERVICE IN CLAIMS AGAINST TRESPASSERS

**4.1** If the claim form is to be served by the court and in accordance with rule 55.6(b) the claimant must provide sufficient stakes and transparent envelopes.
### 55.8 – THE HEARING

**5.1** Attention is drawn to rule 55.8(3). Each party should wherever possible include all the evidence he wishes to present in his statement of case, verified by a statement of truth.

**5.2** If relevant the claimant’s evidence should include the amount of any rent or mortgage arrears and interest on those arrears. These amounts should, if possible, be up to date to the date of the hearing (if necessary by specifying a daily rate of arrears and interest).

(1) the amount of any outstanding social security or housing benefit payments relevant to rent or mortgage arrears; and
(2) the status of:

**A8.1** In the County Court, the claim will be issued by the County Court hearing centre where the claim is made, but will then be sent to the County Court hearing centre which serves the address where the land is situated. A claimant should consider the potential delay which may result if a claim is not made at the appropriate hearing centre in the first instance.

**8.1** If the judge is satisfied as to the matters set out in rule 55.16(2), he will make an order for possession in accordance with rule 55.17, whether or not the defendant seeks a postponement of possession on the ground of exceptional hardship under section 89 of the Housing Act 1980.

**8.2** In a claim in which the judge is satisfied that the defendant has shown exceptional hardship, he will only postpone possession without directing a hearing under rule 55.18(1) if –
(1) he considers that possession should be given up 6 weeks after the date of the order or, if the defendant has requested postponement to an earlier date, on that date; and
(2) the claimant indicated on his claim form that he would be content for the court to make such an order without a hearing.

**8.3** In all other cases if the defendant seeks a postponement of possession under section 89 of the Housing Act 1980, the judge will direct a hearing under rule 55.18(1).

**8.4** If, at that hearing, the judge is satisfied that exceptional hardship would be caused by requiring possession to be given up by the date in the order of possession, he may vary that order under rule 55.18(3) so that possession is to be given up at a later date. That later date may be no later than 6 weeks after the making of the order for possession on the papers (see section 89 of the Housing Act 1980).
## SECTION III – INTERIM POSSESSION ORDERS

**10.2** If the defendant fails to comply with any of the terms of the order which relate to payment, the claimant, after following the procedure set out in paragraph 10.3, may apply for an order fixing the date upon which the defendant has to give up possession of the property. Unless the court further postpones the date for possession, the defendant will be required to give up possession on that date.
