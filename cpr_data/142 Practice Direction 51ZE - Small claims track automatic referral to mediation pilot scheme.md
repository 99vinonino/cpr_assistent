**Scope and interpretatio** n

**3.**
The pilot applies –
(a) to claims to which rule 26.6, as modified by this practice direction, applies; and 
(b) to “OCMC mediation pilot claims”, being claims within scope of Practice Direction 51R – Online Civil Money Claims Pilot– 
(i) that are suitable for allocation to the small claims track; and 
(ii) that are not road traffic accident claims.
**Modification of rules during the pilot**

**4.** During the pilot, the Civil Procedure Rules and practice directions will apply –
(a) with the modifications set out in paragraphs 6 to 10 of this practice direction; and 
(b)in relation to OCMC mediation pilot claims, with the provisions contained in PD 51R – Online Civil Money Claims Pilot which operate at the stage where following a defence, a claimant has confirmed they intend to proceed, the claim is stayed and referred to the small claims mediation service. 
Rules 26.6, 27.8, 27.14 and 45.13 and the relevant provision of Practice Direction 27A as so modified are set out in the annex to this practice direction.

**5.** For claims to which the pilot does not apply, the Civil Procedure Rules and practice directions will continue to apply without modification.

**6.** Modification of rule 26.6: Rule 26.6 is modified as follows—
(a) for paragraph (2) substitute—
“(2) This rule—
(a) applies where the only remedy claimed is, or purports to be, a judgment for a specified sum of money; and
(c) does not in any event apply to road traffic accident or personal injury claims.”;
(b) in paragraph (4), for the words “indicate” to “mediation” substitute “have filed their directions questionnaire”;
(c) after paragraph (5) insert—
“(6) If a claim to which this rule applies proceeds to a final hearing, the court must consider at that hearing whether any sanction is appropriate in all the circumstances having regard to whether the parties attended mediation provided by the Mediation Service.”.

**7.** Modification of rule 27.8: In rule 27.8, after paragraph (6) insert—
“(7) The court must consider whether any sanction is appropriate in all the circumstances having regard to whether the parties attended mediation provided by the Mediation Service.”.

“(2A) When considering how to exercise its discretion to order or decline to order costs falling within paragraph (2) (including when considering under paragraph (2)(g) whether a party has behaved unreasonably), the court may also take into account any failure by a party to attend mediation provided by the Mediation Service under rule 26.6.”.

**9.** Modification of Practice Direction 27A: In Appendix B, for the first standard direction substitute—
“

**1.** Each party must deliver to every other party and to the court office copies of all documents on which they intend to rely at the hearing no later than [ ] [14 days before the hearing]. (These should include the letter making the claim and the reply; and, if a party failed to attend mediation provided by the Mediation Service, that party’s explanation for that failure, and any other party’s comments on the matter, with any supporting documents.)”.

**10.** Modification of rule 45.13: After paragraph (2) insert—
“(2A) The court may also make an order under paragraph (1) or (2) on its own initiative in any case where rule 26.6(6) applies.”.
