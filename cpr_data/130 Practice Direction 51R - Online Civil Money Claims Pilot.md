**(2)** The part admission is treated as if there had been no part defence as well. The court must inform the parties of this.
**(3)** If the claimant uses form OCON225A or the relevant screens on the OCMC website (as appropriate) to accept the defendant’s offer of the amount admitted in full settlement of the claim, but then the claimant has not received the whole amount admitted before the end of the 5 days, the claimant may request a judgment on admission.

The purpose of the calculation is to establish what rate of repayment a defendant is likely to be able to afford, based on the information submitted by the parties: an “affordability calculation repayment plan”.
**(3)** The explanation of the formula is set out in Annex A to this practice direction.
**(4)** If the affordability calculation indicates that the defendant will not be able to afford to repay the amount admitted in accordance with the claimant’s repayment plan, the court will tell the claimant, and ask the claimant whether they accept or reject the affordability calculation repayment plan instead.
**(5)** The claimant may accept or reject the affordability calculation repayment plan using the OCMC website.

**(4A)** If a repayment date specified in the affordability calculation repayment plan has passed before the judgment is made, the judgment must still be made in accordance with that repayment plan, but –
(a) if the repayment plan states that the whole of the amount owed is to be paid by a date that has passed, the judgment must state that repayment must be made immediately;
(b) if the repayment plan states that the amount owed is to be paid by instalments and the date of the first instalment has passed, the judgment must state that the first instalment must be made by a date that is one calendar month after the date of the judgment, and with subsequent instalments to be paid at one calendar month intervals after that.
**(5)** If, after judgment has been made, the defendant objects to the affordability calculation repayment plan, or if the claimant no longer agrees to the plan, they may ask, on time, for a redetermination by a judge of the plan for the repayment of the amount admitted by the defendant. The claimant or defendant may make their request for redetermination to the court, by email to the OCMC email address, or on paper to the OCMC postal address (as defined). When requesting a redetermination, the claimant or defendant must explain why they object to the affordability calculation repayment plan.
**(6)** The request for redetermination will be submitted to the court on time if it is received by the court within 19 days after the date of the judgment.
**(7)** If the court receives a request for redetermination on time, it must send the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims to the defendant’s “home court” (as defined).

---|---|---  
Claimant| Change repayment plan to be more favourable to the defendant| N294  
Claimant| Change repayment plan to be less favourable to the defendant| N244

**Defendant’s response under paragraph 5.1 Table A using form N9B – alternative responses**
**9.1(1)** Sub-paragraph (2) applies if, under paragraph 5.1 Table A, the defendant uses form N9B to make their response. Such a response is referred to as an “alternative response”. An example of alternative response is where the defendant counterclaims or brings another additional claim under Part 20 of the Civil Procedure Rules.

(b) the rest of the Civil Procedure Rules and other practice directions will continue to apply with the following change: rule 26.4 (provisional allocation of a case to a case track in the court, and directions questionnaires) will apply as if the defendant filed the defence when the CNBC received the defendant’s paper response form from Online Civil Money Claims.

(6) If the applicant requests that the online application is made without notice to the respondent, the application is to be referred to a judge to consider the request, or referred to a legal adviser for the legal adviser to consider the request, if it would be appropriate for the legal adviser to do so. It will only be appropriate for a legal adviser to consider a request if a provision elsewhere in the Civil Procedure Rules enables them to consider requests of this type.
(7) After an online application has been made and unless the application is to be dealt with without notice, the respondent must provide initial information to assist with managing the future conduct of the application (“respondent information”) by –

(9) The respondent must provide their respondent information –
(a) before 4pm on the 5th day after the date of notification of the online application; or

(2) Any application made under subparagraph (1) is to be made to the CTSC or, where the parties have received an order from a judge or “legal adviser”(as defined) at a County Court hearing centre, or have been informed that the claim is to be managed at a County Court hearing centre, that hearing centre. When the court receives any such application, the application must be considered by a judge or a “legal adviser” (as defined), if appropriate, who must give directions as to how the application is to be handled, which may include that the claim is to be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims.

**18.2(2)** If the reason that the claim is not, or is no longer, suitable or appropriate for the pilot is that a party wishes to take a step in the proceedings not catered for by the pilot then the court must automatically send the claim out of the pilot to the CNBC unless the claim had already been sent to a County Court hearing centre, in which case the court must send the claim out of the pilot to that hearing centre.

(d) if a claim is complicated, the legal adviser must send the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims to the “preferred court” (as defined); and
(e) a legal adviser must not send a claim out of the pilot until the later of–

## SECTION 21 – CHANGE TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION – DIGITAL NOTICES OF CHANGE
### Change to legal representation – digital notices of change
**21.1(1)** Unless using MyHMCTS to file notice of a change of solicitor, a party complies with CPR 42.2(2)(a) by filing the notice of the change required by that rule –
(a) at the CNBC; or
(b) if the claim has been sent to a County Court hearing centre, at that hearing centre.
**21.1(2)** A party may only use MyHMCTS to file notice of change of solicitor where –
(a) the claimant is legally represented and —
(i) the change is from one legal representative to another; or
(ii) the defendant who was acting in person is to be represented by a legal representative;
(b) the claimant was acting in person is to be represented by a legal representative; or
(c) the claimant is acting in person and the defendant was also acting in person but is to be represented by a legal representative, in circumstances where the incoming legal representative is registered with MyHMCTS and has been provided with access to Online Civil Money Claims.
**21.1(3)** If a party files a notice of change and either does not use MyHMCTS to file the notice, or used MyHMCTS to file the notice under subparagraph (2)(c), the court must transfer the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims to continue –
(a) at the CNBC; or
(b) if the claim has been sent to a County Court hearing centre, at that hearing centre, as if it had been started under CPR Part 7.
**21.1(4)** If a notice of change is filed under sub-paragraph (2)(a)(ii) so the effect is that a previously unrepresented defendant is to be represented and MyHMCTS is used to file the notice of change so that the claim remains in the pilot, from the point at which the notice is filed, the claim is to be treated and this practice direction applies, as a claim where all parties are represented.
