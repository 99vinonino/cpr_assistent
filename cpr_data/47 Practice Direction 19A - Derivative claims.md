### Application of this practice direction

**1** This practice direction applies to derivative claims and applications for permission to continue or take over such claims within the scope of rule 19.14(1)
### Early intervention by the company

**2** The decision whether the claimant’s evidence discloses a prima facie case will normally be made without submissions from or (in the case of an oral hearing to reconsider such a decision reached pursuant to rule 19.15(9)) attendance by the company. If without invitation from the court the company volunteers a submission or attendance, the company will not normally be allowed any costs of that submission or attendance.

(2) Where such an application is made in a county court it will be decided by a circuit judge.
### Discontinuance of derivative claim

**4** The order under rule 19.20 may be appropriate where any future proposal to discontinue or settle might not come to the attention of members who might have an interest in taking over the claim.
