## Interpretation

**1.1** In this practice direction ‘the Act’ means the Consumer Credit Act 1974, a section referred to by number means the section with that number in the Act, and expressions which are defined in the Act have the same meaning in this practice direction as they have in the Act.

**1.2** ‘Consumer Credit Act procedure’ means the procedure set out in this practice direction.
## When to use the Consumer Credit Act procedure

**2.1** A claimant must use the Consumer Credit Act procedure where they make a claim under a provision of the Act to which paragraph 3 of this practice direction applies.

**2.2** Where a claimant is using the Consumer Credit Act procedure the CPR are modified to the extent that they are inconsistent with the procedure set out in this practice direction.

**2.3** The court may at any stage order the claim to continue as if the claimant had not used the Consumer Credit Act procedure, and if it does so the court may give any directions it considers appropriate.

**2.4** This practice direction also sets out matters which must be included in the particulars of claim in certain types of claim, and restrictions on where certain types of claim may be started.
## The provisions of the Act

**3.1** Subject to paragraph 3.2 and 3.3 this practice direction applies to claims made under the following provisions of the Act—
(1) section 141 (claim by the creditor to enforce regulated agreement relating to goods etc),
(2) section 129 (claim by debtor or hirer for a time order),
(3) section 90 (creditor’s claim for an order for recovery of protected goods),
(4) section 92(1) (creditor’s or owner’s claim to enter premises to take possession of goods),
(5) section 140B(2)(a) (debtor’s or surety’s application for an order relating to an unfair relationship);

**3.2** This practice direction does not apply to any claim made under the provisions listed in paragraph 3.1 above if that claim relates to the recovery of land.

**3.3** This practice direction also does not apply to a claim made by the creditor under section 141 of the Act to enforce a regulated agreement where the agreement relates only to money. Such a claim must be started by the issue of a Part 7 claim form.
