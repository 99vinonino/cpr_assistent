**1.8**
(1) This Practice Direction will continue to apply to any claim started under the procedures in sections 2 to 11, unless sub-paragraph (2) applies.

(b) the claim involves complex issues of fact or law;
(c) the defendant has made an allegation of fraud or fundamental dishonesty against the claimant;
(d) the defendant disputes or continues to dispute that the **accident** caused any injury to the claimant following service by the claimant of a medical report in support of the injuries;

(4) Where sub-paragraph (1)(f) applies, the court may allocate the claim to a different track and will give directions.

**Admissions made under the RTA Small Claims Protocol**

**1.9**
(1) An admission of liability made in the **RTA Small Claims Protocol** is binding to the extent of all claims made by the claimant in proceedings under this Practice Direction.
(2) Where a claim by another party or a counterclaim is added to proceedings under this Practice Direction, the admission of liability is not binding in respect of that other claim or counterclaim (but the court may give evidence of the admission such weight as the court considers fit).
(3) On the making of an application by either party to the court to withdraw a pre-action admission in accordance with rule 14.1B and Part 23, the claim will no longer proceed under this Practice Direction. The court must on receipt of the application allocate the claim to a different track.
(4) A claimant who is a litigant in person should consider obtaining legal advice in respect of any such application.
**Statements of truth**

**1.10** Rule 22.1(1)(f) applies to any court form used by the claimant to start or continue proceedings and any acknowledgment of service form used under this Practice Direction.
**First medical reports**

**1.11**
(1) Where the claimant wishes to start proceedings under this Practice Direction to assess the value of the claim, they may not do so unless the medical report relied upon (or, if there is more than one report, the first report) is a **fixed cost medical report** from an **accredited medical expert** selected via **MedCo** (website at: [www.MedCo.org.uk](http://www.medco.org.uk/)).
**(2)** Where the claimant lives outside England and Wales but chooses to be examined for the purposes of a medical report in England and Wales, sub-paragraph (1) above applies.
(3) Otherwise where the claimant lives outside England and Wales, the medical report relied upon (or, if there is more than one report, the first report) must—
(a) in a claim which includes a whiplash injury, be from a person who is recognised by the country in which they practise as—
(i) being a medical expert; and
(ii) having the required qualifications for the purposes of diagnosis and prognosis of a whiplash injury;
(b) in a claim which does not include a whiplash injury, be from a person who is recognised by the country in which they practise as being a medical expert.
**Further medical reports**

**1.12**
**(1) Where the claimant seeks to rely on a further medical report, whether from the first expert instructed or from an expert in another discipline, permission may only be given where the use of that report is justified as set out in sub-paragraph (2) below.**
**(2)** A further medical report will be justified where—
(a) it is recommended in the first expert’s report;
(b) the first medical report recommends that further time is required before a prognosis of the claimant’s injuries can be determined;
(c) the claimant is receiving continuing treatment; or
(d) the claimant has not recovered as expected in the original prognosis.
(3) Any further report from an expert in any of the following disciplines must also be a **fixed cost medical report** —
(a) Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon;
(b) Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine;
(c) General Practitioner registered with the General Medical Council;
(d) Physiotherapist registered with the Health and Care Professions Council.
(4) Paragraph 1.14 below sets out the fees applicable to fixed cost medical reports.
**Limited costs recovery**

**1.13** Rule 27.14 applies to a claim under this Practice Direction with the following modifications—
(a) the court may order under rule 27.14(2) that the defendant pay the cost of any police accident report incurred by the claimant;
(b) without prejudice to the generality of rule 27.14(2)(g), when a **compensator** is required under the**RTA Small Claims Protocol** to arrange a further medical report when requested by the claimant and justified under paragraph 1.12 above and—
(i) fails to do so in time or at all; or
(ii) raises an objection to doing so which is not reasonable,
the court is likely to consider that such conduct amounts to unreasonable behaviour and to order payment of any legal costs incurred by the claimant as a result.
**Costs – Experts’ fees**

**1.14**
(1) Rule 27.14(2)(f) will apply to experts’ fees, including those of non-medical experts, to limit such fees to a sum not exceeding the amount specified in Practice Direction 27A paragraph 7.3(2) for the fees of each expert except where sub-paragraph (2) applies.
(2) The only sums that are recoverable in respect of the fees for a **fixed cost medical report** or medical records are as follows—
(a) the first report from an **accredited medical expert** selected via **MedCo** : £226;
(b) a further report where justified from an expert from one of the following disciplines—
(i) Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon (inclusive of a review of medical records where applicable): £527;
(ii) Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine: £451;
(iii) General Practitioner registered with the General Medical Council: £226; or
(iv) Physiotherapist registered with the Health and Care Professions Council: £226;
(c) obtaining medical records: no more than £38 plus the direct cost from the holder of the records, and limited to £100 in total for each set of records required. Where relevant records are required from more than one holder of records, the fixed fee applies to each set of records required;
(d) addendum report on medical records (except by Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon): £63.
(3) Save in exceptional circumstances, no fee may be allowed for a report to which sub-paragraph (2) applies where the **medical expert** —
(a) has provided treatment to the claimant;
(b) is associated with any person who has provided treatment; or
(c) proposes or recommends treatment that they or an associate then provide.
(4) The fee for a further report from an expert not listed in sub-paragraph (2)(b) is not fixed, but—
(a) is limited by rule 27.14(2)(f); and
(b) the use of that expert must be justified.
(5) Where appropriate, VAT may be recovered in addition to the fees for a **fixed cost medical report** or medical records.
**Free text fields – character limits**

**1.15**
(1) Where a free text field is provided on the **Portal** in order to complete the relevant court form, the content is limited to 500 characters (including spaces). The number of characters available is displayed immediately below the field.

**Other claims**

**2.14**
(1) Where either party identifies in form RTASC L or form RTAASL that there is another claim arising out of the same **accident** where liability is disputed, the court will consider whether to direct that—
