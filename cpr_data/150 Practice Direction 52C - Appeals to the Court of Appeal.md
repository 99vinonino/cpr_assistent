### Respondents actions when served with the appellant’s notice

**19.**
(1)
(a) If the appellant seeks permission to appeal a respondent is permitted, and is encouraged, within 14 days of service of the appellant’s notice or skeleton argument if later to file and serve upon the appellant and any other respondent a brief statement of any reasons why permission should be refused, in whole or in part.
(b) The statement should be not more than 3 pages long, and should be directed to the relevant threshold test for the grant of permission to appeal. The statement must also comply with paragraph 31(1)(b).
(c) The statement should identify issues to which the appeal should be limited, and any conditions to which the appeal should be subject (see Rule 52.6(2)).
(2)
(a) If the appellant makes any application in addition to an application for permission to appeal (such as a stay of execution, an injunction pending appeal or an extension of time for appeal) a respondent should include in its written statement under paragraph 19(1)(a) any reasons why that application should be refused or granted only on terms.
(b) If, exceptionally, a respondent wishes to rely upon evidence for that purpose its evidence should be included in its written statement, supported by a statement of truth, or filed and served upon the appellant and any other respondent at the same time as its written statement under paragraph 19(1)(a).
(3) Unless the court directs otherwise, a respondent need take no further steps when served with an appellant’s notice prior to being notified that permission to appeal has been granted.

### Respondent’s costs of permission applications

**20.**
(1) There will normally be no order for the recovery of the costs of a respondent’s written statement. In most cases an application for permission to appeal will be determined without the need for the respondent to attend a hearing. In such circumstances an order for costs will not normally be made in favour of a respondent who voluntarily attends a hearing.
(2) If the court directs the respondent to file submissions or attend a hearing, it will normally award costs to the respondent if permission is refused.
