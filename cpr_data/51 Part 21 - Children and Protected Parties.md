(5) Where a child or protected beneficiary is in receipt of publicly funded legal services the fund shall be subject to a first charge under section 25 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012(1) (statutory charge) and an order for the investment of money on the child’s or protected beneficiary’s behalf must contain a direction to that effect.

(7) The judge hearing the application may adjourn it and give directions for further information to be provided and, unless the judge directs otherwise, the money recovered will be paid into the court special account pending determination of the application for investment.

(b) the procedure in sub-paragraph (a) will not apply where a person with authority to administer the protected beneficiary’s financial affairs has been appointed as attorney under a registered enduring power of attorney, or as donee of a registered lasting power of attorney, or as the deputy appointed by the Court of Protection;
(c) any payment out of money must be in accordance with any decision or order of the Court of Protection;
(d) if an application to the Court of Protection is required, that application must be made;
(e) if the Court of Protection so decides, on its own initiative or at the request of the judge hearing the application for investment, an amount exceeding £100,000 may be retained in court and invested in the same way as the fund of a child.
(10) A request for payment of money from a fund held for the benefit of a child or protected party, or to vary an investment strategy, may be made in writing with appropriate supporting evidence (but without making a formal application) to a Master or District Judge and may be determined without a hearing unless the court directs otherwise.

(Costs and expenses which are also “costs” as defined in rule 44.1(1) are subject to rule 46.4(2) and (3).)
(5) In deciding whether the costs or expenses were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount, the court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors set out in rule 44.4(3) and 46.9.
(6) When the court is considering the factors to be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the costs or expenses, it will have regard to the facts and circumstances as they reasonably appeared to the litigation friend or to the child’s or protected party’s legal representative or deputy when the cost or expense was incurred.
(7) Subject to paragraph (7), where the claim is settled or compromised, or judgment is given, on terms that an amount not exceeding £5,000 is paid to the child or protected party, the total amount the litigation friend may recover under paragraph (1) must not exceed 25% of the sum so agreed or awarded, unless the court directs otherwise. Such total amount must not exceed 50% of the sum so agreed or awarded.

(b) damages for past financial loss
(9) Except in a case to which Section IV, Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of Part 45 applies, and where a claim under rule 45.9 or 45.10 has not been made, no application may be made under this rule for a payment out of the money recovered by the child or protected party until the costs payable to the child or protected party have been assessed or agreed.
(10) A litigation friend must support a claim for payment from a fund of costs or expenses by filing a witness statement setting out, so far as applicable—
