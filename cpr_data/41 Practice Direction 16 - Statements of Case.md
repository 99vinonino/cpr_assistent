**2.3** If the claim form does not include a full address, including postcode, for all parties the claim form will be issued but retained by the court and not served until the claimant has supplied a full address, including postcode, or the court has dispensed with the requirement to do so.

(b) the report provides evidence of the whiplash injury.
(3) Unless paragraph (1)(c) applies, in any other case where the claimant lives outside England and Wales, the medical report in respect of the claim for the whiplash injury (or, if there is more than one report, the first report) must be from a person who is recognised by the country in which they practise as—
(i) being a medical expert; and
(ii) having the required qualifications for the purposes of diagnosis and prognosis of a whiplash injury.
(4)The cost of obtaining a further report from an expert not listed in paragraph (4)(a) to (d) is not subject to rule 45.62(2)(b), but the use of that expert and the cost must be justified.
(5) In this paragraph, ‘fixed cost medical report’, ‘accredited medical expert’, ‘MedCo, and ‘whiplash injury’ have the same meaning as in paragraph 1.2(1), (17), (19) and (38), respectively, of the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents.
