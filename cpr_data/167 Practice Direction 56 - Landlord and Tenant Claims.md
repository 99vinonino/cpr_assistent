## SECTION I – LANDLORD AND TENANT CLAIMS

**1.1** In this section of this practice direction –
(1) ‘the 1927 Act’ means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927;
(2) ‘the 1954 Act’ means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954;
(3) ‘the 1985 Act’ means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985; and
(4) ‘the 1987 Act’ means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987.
### 56.2 – STARTING THE CLAIM

**2.1** Subject to paragraph 2.1A, the claimant in a landlord and tenant claim must use the Part 8 procedure as modified by Part 56 and this practice direction.

**2.1A** Where the landlord and tenant claim is a claim for –
(1) a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act in circumstances where the grant of a new tenancy is opposed; or
(2) the termination of a tenancy under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act,
the claimant must use the Part 7 procedure as modified by Part 56 and this practice direction.

**2.2**
(1) Except where the county court does not have jurisdiction , landlord and tenant claims should normally be brought in the county court. Only exceptional circumstances justify starting a claim in the High Court.
(2) In the County Court, the claim will be issued by the County Court hearing centre where the claim is made and will then be sent to the County Court hearing centre which serves the address where the land is situated. A claimant should consider the potential delay which may result if a claim is not sent to the appropriate County Court hearing centre in the first instance.

**2.3** If a claimant starts a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the county court, the court will normally either strike the claim out or transfer it to the county court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay and the court will normally disallow the costs of starting the claim in the High Court and of any transfer.

**2.4** Circumstances which may, in an appropriate case, justify starting a claim in the High Court are if –
(1) there are complicated disputes of fact; or
(2) there are points of law of general importance.

**2.5** The value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances, but these factors alone will not normally justify starting the claim in the High Court.

**2.6** A landlord and tenant claim started in the High Court must be brought in the Chancery Division.
(Where the tenant is a tied pub tenant of a pub-owning business under the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, the procedure provided by paragraphs 3.1 to 3.19 of this practice direction is modified by paragraphs 3.20 to 3.32.)
### Claims for a new tenancy under section 24 and termination of a tenancy under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act

**3.1** This paragraph applies to a claim for a new tenancy under section 24 and termination of a tenancy under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act where rule 56.3 applies and in this paragraph –
(1) ‘an unopposed claim’ means a claim for a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act in circumstances where the grant of a new tenancy is not opposed;
(2) ‘an opposed claim’ means a claim for –
(a) a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act in circumstances where the grant of a new tenancy is opposed; or
(b) the termination of a tenancy under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act; and
(3) ‘grounds of opposition’ means –
(a) the grounds specified in section 30(1) of the 1954 Act on which a landlord may oppose an application for a new tenancy under section 24(1) of the 1954 Act or make an application under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act; or
(b) any other basis on which the landlord asserts that a new tenancy ought not to be granted.
#### Precedence of claim forms where there is more than one application to the court under section 24(1) or section 29(2) of the 1954 Act

**3.2** Where more than one application to the court under section 24(1) or section 29(2) of the 1954 Act is made, the following provisions shall apply –
(1) once an application to the court under section 24(1) of the 1954 Act has been served on a defendant, no further application to the court in respect of the same tenancy whether under section 24(1) or section 29(2) of the 1954 Act may be served by that defendant without the permission of the court;
(2) if more than one application to the court under section 24(1) of the 1954 Act in respect of the same tenancy is served on the same day, any landlord’s application shall stand stayed until further order of the court;
(3) if applications to the court under both section 24(1) and section 29(2) of the 1954 Act in respect of the same tenancy are served on the same day, any tenant’s application shall stand stayed until further order of the court; and
(4) if a defendant is served with an application under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act (‘the section 29(2) application’) which was issued at a time when an application to the court had already been made by that defendant in respect of the same tenancy under section 24(1) of the 1954 Act (‘the section 24(1) application’), the service of the section 29(2) application shall be deemed to be a notice under rule 7.7 requiring service or discontinuance of the section 24(1) application within a period of 14 days after the service of the section 29(2) application.
#### Defendant where the claimant is the tenant making a claim for a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act

**3.3** Where a claim for a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act is made by a tenant, the person who, in relation to the claimant’s current tenancy, is the landlord as defined in section 44 of the 1954 Act must be a defendant.
