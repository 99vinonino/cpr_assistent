[To the top](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part35#top)
## Court’s power to restrict expert evidence
### 35.4
(1) No party may call an expert or put in evidence an expert’s report without the court’s permission.
(2) When parties apply for permission they must provide an estimate of the costs of the proposed expert evidence and identify –
(a) the field in which expert evidence is required and the issues which the expert evidence will address; and
(b) where practicable, the name of the proposed expert.
(3) If permission is granted it shall be in relation only to the expert named or the field identified under paragraph (2). The order granting permission may specify the issues which the expert evidence should address.
(3A) Where a claim has been allocated to the small claims track or the fast track, if permission is given for expert evidence, it will normally be given for evidence from only one expert on a particular issue.
(3B) In a soft tissue injury claim, permission—
(a) may normally only be given for one expert medical report;
(b) may not be given initially unless the medical report is a fixed cost medical report. Where the claimant seeks permission to obtain a further medical report, if the report is from a medical expert in any of the following disciplines—
(i) Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon;
(ii) Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine;
(iii) General Practitioner registered with the General Medical Council; or
(iv) Physiotherapist registered with the Health and Care Professions Council, the report must be a fixed cost medical report.
(3C) In a claim for a whiplash injury, whether or not it is part of a claim for other injuries—
(a) permission—
(i) may normally only be given for one expert medical report in respect of the claim for the whiplash injury; and
(ii) may not be given initially unless the medical report is a fixed cost medical report; and
(b) where the claimant seeks permission to obtain a further medical report in respect of the claim for the whiplash injury only, the report must be a fixed cost medical report if the report is from a medical expert in any of the following disciplines—
(i) Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon;
(ii) Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine;
(iii) General Practitioner registered with the General Medical Council; or
(iv) Physiotherapist registered with the Health and Care Professions Council.
(3D) Where, in respect of a claim for a whiplash injury, the claimant lives outside England and Wales, but chooses to be examined in England or Wales, paragraph (3C) applies.
(3E) Where the claimant obtains a medical report in respect of a more serious injury suffered on the same occasion as the whiplash injury, the claimant may be given permission to use that report instead of a fixed cost medical report under paragraph (3C) provided that—
(a) the report is from a doctor who is listed on the General Medical Council’s Specialist Register; and
(b) the report provides evidence of the whiplash injury.
(3F) Unless paragraph (3D) applies, where, in respect of a claim for a whiplash injury—
(a) the claimant lives outside England and Wales;
(b) permission is given for a medical report,
the medical report (or, if there is more than one report, the first report) must be obtained from a person who is recognised by the country in which they practise as—
(i) being a medical expert; and
(ii) having the required medical qualifications for the purposes of diagnosis and prognosis of a whiplash injury.
(3G) In this rule—
(a) in respect of a soft tissue injury claim, ‘fixed cost medical report’ and ‘soft tissue injury claim’ have the meanings ascribed to them by paragraph 1.1(10A) and (16A), respectively, of the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents; and
(b) in respect of a claim for a whiplash injury, ‘fixed cost medical report’ and ‘whiplash injury’ have the meanings ascribed to them by paragraph 1.2(17) and (38), respectively, of the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents
(4) The court may limit the amount of a party’s expert’s fees and expenses that may be recovered from any other party.
