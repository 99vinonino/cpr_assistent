### Fees

**4.1** A step may only be taken using Possession Claims Online on payment of the prescribed fee where a fee is payable. Where this practice direction provides for a fee to be paid electronically, it may be paid by –
(1) credit card;
(2) debit card; or
(3) any other method which HM Courts and Tribunals Service may permit.

**4.2** A defendant who wishes to claim exemption from payment of fees must do so through an organisation approved by HM Courts and Tribunals Service before taking any step using PCOL which attracts a fee. If satisfied that the defendant is entitled to fee exemption, the organisation will submit the fee exemption form through the PCOL website to HM Courts and Tribunals Service. The defendant may then use PCOL to take such a step.
(HM Courts and Tribunals Service website contains guidance as to when the entitlement to claim an exemption from payment of fees arises. The PCOL website will contain a list of organisations through which the defendant may claim an exemption from fees).
