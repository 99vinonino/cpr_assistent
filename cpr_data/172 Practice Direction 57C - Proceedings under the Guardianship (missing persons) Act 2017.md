### Public Guardian to be supplied with court documents relevant to supervision of guardians

**9.1** Subject to paragraphs 9.2 and 9.5, where the court makes a guardianship order, a revocation/variation order or any order relating to a guardianship order, the Public Guardian is entitled to be supplied by the court with a copy of qualifying documents if the Public Guardian reasonably considers that it is necessary to have regard to them in connection with the discharge of the Public Guardian’s functions under section 17 of the 2017 Act in relation to supervision of guardians.

**9.2** “Qualifying documents” means the following documents which are filed in court in connection with the proceedings referred to in sub-paragraph 9.1 if not already provided to the Public Guardian—
(a) claim form seeking a guardianship order and any accompanying witness statement;
(b) any application notice seeking a revocation/variation order or an order relating to a guardianship order and any accompanying witness statement;
(c)any notice of intention to intervene or application for permission to intervene.

(ii) subsequently.
### Security Bonds – guardianship order requiring a guardian to give security for discharge of functions

**10.1** Where the court makes a guardianship order which requires the guardian to give security for the discharge of his functions as guardian, the guardian must give the security before discharging any functions under the guardianship order, unless the court permits the security to be given subsequently.

**10.2** Paragraphs 10.3 to 10.5 apply where the security is required to be given before the guardian discharges any functions under the guardianship order.

**10.3** Subject to paragraph 10.4, the security must be given in accordance with the requirements of regulation 33(2)(a) of the Lasting Powers of Attorney, Enduring Powers of Attorney and Public Guardian Regulations 2007 (which makes provision about the giving of security by means of a bond that is endorsed by an authorised insurance company or an authorised deposit-taker).

**10.4** The court may impose other requirements in relation to the giving of the security as it considers appropriate (whether in addition to, or instead of, those specified in paragraph 10.3).

**10.5** In specifying the date from which the guardianship order referred to in paragraph 10.1 is to take effect, the court will consider the need to postpone that date for such reasonable period as would enable the Public Guardian to be satisfied that—
(1) if paragraph 10.3 applies, the requirements of regulation 34 of the Lasting Powers of Attorney, Enduring Powers of Attorney and Public Guardian Regulations 2007 have been met in relation to the security; and
(2) any other requirements imposed by the court under paragraph 10.4 have been met.
### Code of Practice

Attention is drawn to section 22(3) which provides that a court must take into account the relevant provisions of such a Code(s) and any failure to comply with such a Code(s) when deciding any question arising in legal proceedings. Accordingly, claimants, applicants and others should consult the Code(s) at all stages of 2017 Act proceedings, and draw the court’s attention to their provisions where and when relevant.”
