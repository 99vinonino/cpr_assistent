the recovery order will make provision under section 266(8A) of the Act or article 177(10) of the Order in Council (as appropriate) for the payment of those costs.
#### 7B.2
Where the court makes a recovery order which provides for the payment of a person’s reasonable legal costs in respect of civil recovery proceedings, it will at the same time order the detailed assessment of those costs. Parts 4 and 5 of the Regulations CPR, Part 47 as modified by Parts 4 and 5 of the Regulations and paragraphs 7B.3 to 7B.7 of this Practice Direction (“the civil recovery costs provisions”) apply to a detailed assessment pursuant to such an order.

The documents which must accompany the request for a detailed assessment hearing must include copies of all exclusions from property freezing orders or interim freezing orders made by the court for the purpose of enabling the receiving party to meet the costs which are to be assessed, and of every estimate of costs filed in relation to such an exclusion.
#### 7B.7 
The receiving party’s costs will be assessed on the standard basis, subject to Part 5 of the Regulations (and in particular regulation 17, which specifies the hourly rates which may be allowed).
