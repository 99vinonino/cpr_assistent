## SECTION I – GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO JUDICIAL REVIEW

**1.1** In addition to [Part 54](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0295220712&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)) and this Practice Direction attention is drawn to: (a) CPR Part 1; (b) [section 31 of the Senior Courts Act 1981](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0111235108&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)); (c) the [Human Rights Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0292647670&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)); and (d) the Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide
## The Court

**2.1**(1) Part 54 claims for judicial review are dealt with in the Administrative Court.
(2) In exercise of the power under section 18(6) of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, the Lord Chief Justice has directed that certain classes of claims for judicial review fall within the jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal: see the directions dated 21 August 2013 and 24 October 2014.
(3) Practice Direction 54C contains provisions about where a claim for judicial review may be started, administered and heard. CPR rule 7.1A provides the general rule that claims against Welsh public bodies challenging the lawfulness of their decisions are to be issued and heard in Wales.
## Rule 54.5—Time Limit for Filing Claim Form

**3.1** Where the claim is for a quashing order in respect of a judgment, order or conviction, the date when the grounds to make the claim first arose, for the purposes of [rule 54.5(1)(b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0116692707&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)), is the date of that judgment, order or conviction.
## Rule 54.6—Claim Form
**General**

**4.1**(1) A claimant seeking permission to apply for judicial review, urgent consideration or interim relief (whether by a claim included in the Claim Form itself or by a separate application notice) must ensure that the Claim Form or application notice sets out all material facts, that is all those facts which are relevant to the claim or application being made. A claimant must make proper and necessary inquiries before seeking permission to apply for judicial review or interim relief to ensure so far as reasonably possible that all relevant facts are known.
(2) A claimant should refer to any statutory provision which excludes the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the application, or to grant the relief sought, and should also refer to any alternative appeal mechanism that exists, or could have been used prior to seeking judicial review
**Contents of the Claim Form**

**4.2**(1) The Claim Form must include or be accompanied by the following documents—
(a) a clear and concise statement of the facts relied on set out in numbered paragraphs – “the Statement of Facts”; and
(b) a clear and concise statement of the grounds for bringing the claim – “the Statement of Grounds”. The Statement of Grounds should: identify in separate, numbered paragraphs each ground of challenge; identify the relevant provision or principle of law said to have been breached; and provide sufficient detail of the alleged breach to enable the parties and the court to identify the essential issues alleged to arise. The Statement of Grounds should succinctly explain the claimant’s case by reference to the Statement of Facts and state precisely what relief is sought.
(2) The Statement of Facts and the Statement of Grounds may be contained in a single document.
(3) The Statements of Facts and Grounds should be as concise as possible. The two documents together (or the single document if the two are combined) shall not exceed 40 pages. In many cases the court will expect the documents to be significantly shorter than 40 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 40-page limit.

**4.3** Any application (a) to extend the time limit for filing the Claim Form; and/or (b) for directions in the claim, should be included in or contained in a document that accompanies the Claim Form.

**4.4**(1) In addition, the Claim Form must be accompanied by—
(a) any written evidence in support of the claim (in this regard, see also [rules 8.5(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0111255320&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)) and [8.5(7)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0111255320&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\))).
(b) any written evidence in support of any other application contained in the Claim Form;
(c) a copy of any order that the claimant seeks to have quashed;
(d) where the claim for judicial review relates to a decision of a court or tribunal, an approved copy of the reasons for reaching that decision;
(e) where the claim is directed to the decision of any other public authority, a copy of any record of the decision under challenge;
(f) copies of any documents on which the claimant proposes to rely;
(g) copies of any relevant statutory material; and
(h) a list of essential documents for advance reading by the court (with page references to the passages relied on).
(2) Where it is not possible to file all the above documents, the claimant must indicate which documents have not been filed and the reasons why they are not currently available.
**The claim bundle**

**4.5**(1) The claimant must prepare a paginated and indexed bundle containing all the documents referred to in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.4. An electronic version of the bundle must also be prepared in accordance with the Guidance on the Administrative Court website.
(2) The claimant shall (unless otherwise requested) lodge the bundle with the Court in both electronic and hard copy form. For Divisional Court cases the number of hard copy bundles required will be one set for each judge hearing the case.
**Interested parties**

**4.6**(1) Any person who is an interested party (see rule 54.1(2)(f)) must be named in the Claim Form as such (see [rule 54.6(1)(a)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0116692715&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\))), and served with the Claim Form (see [rule 54.7(b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0290628409&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)).
(2) Where the claim for judicial review relates to proceedings in a court or tribunal, any other party to those proceedings will be an interested party in the judicial review proceedings. For example, if the defendant in a criminal case in the Magistrates or Crown Court applies for judicial review of a decision in that case, the prosecution must always be named as an interested party in the judicial review claim.
**Human rights**

**4.7** Where the claimant is seeking to raise any issue under the [Human Rights Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0292647670&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)), or seeks a remedy available under that Act, the Claim Form must include the information required by paragraph 14.1 of Practice Direction 16.
**Devolution issues**

**4.8**(1) In this Practice Direction “devolution issue” has the same meaning as in [paragraph 1, Schedule 9 to the Government of Wales Act 2006](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0305523010&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)), [paragraph 1, Schedule 10 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0111125684&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)); and [paragraph 1, Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0111187170&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)).
(2) Where the claimant intends to raise a devolution issue, the Claim Form must: (a) specify that the claimant wishes to raise a devolution issue and identify the relevant provisions of the [Government of Wales Act 2006](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0305521939&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)), the [Northern Ireland Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0292711382&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)) or the [Scotland Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0292772381&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)); and (b) contain a summary of the facts, circumstances and points of law on the basis of which it is alleged that a devolution issue arises.

## Rule 54.8—Acknowledgment of Service

**6.1** The Acknowledgment of Service must contain the information specified at rules 8.3(2) and 10.5.

**6.2**(1) If a defendant chooses to file an Acknowledgement of Service, the Summary Grounds referred to in CPR 54.8(4)(a) should meet the following requirements.
(2) The Summary Grounds should identify succinctly any relevant facts. Material matters of factual dispute (if any) should be identified. The Grounds should provide a brief summary of the reasoning underlying the measure in respect of which permission to apply for judicial review is sought unless the defendant gives reasons why the application for permission can be determined without that information.
(3) The Summary Grounds should (again succinctly) explain the legal basis of defendant’s response to the claimant’s case, by reference to relevant facts.
(4) The Summary Grounds should be as concise as possible. Summary Grounds shall not exceed 30 pages. In many cases the court will expect the Summary Grounds to be significantly shorter. The court may grant permission to exceed the 30-page limit.
## Rule 54.8A – Reply to acknowledgment of service

**7.1** (1) A Reply should be filed only if necessary for the purpose of the court’s decision to grant permission to apply for judicial review, for example, where a discrete issue not addressed in the Claim Form is raised in the Acknowledgement of Service. A Reply is not the occasion to rehearse matters already referred to in the Claim Form.
(2) A Reply shall be as concise as possible and shall not exceed 5 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 5-page limit.

**7.2** If a Reply is filed unnecessarily, the court may make any order it considers appropriate, whether as to costs or otherwise.
## Rule 54.10—Permission Given
**Directions**

**8.1** Case management directions under [rule 54.10(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0116692736&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)) may include directions about serving the Claim Form and any evidence on other persons.

**8.2** Where a claim is made under the [Human Rights Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0292647670&pubNum=121177&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)), a direction may be made for giving notice to the Crown or joining the Crown as a party. Attention is drawn to [rule 19.4A](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0295393962&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)) (parties to Human Rights Act claims) and paragraph 6 of Practice Direction 19A (giving notice to the Crown of claims for declarations of incompatibility).
**Rule 54.12—Permission decision without a hearing**

**8.3** In the first instance, the court will generally consider the question of permission without a hearing.
**Permission hearings**

**8.4** Neither the defendant nor any other interested party need attend a hearing on the question of permission unless the court directs otherwise.

**8.5** Where the defendant or any party does attend a hearing, the court will not generally make an order for costs against the claimant.
**Renewed applications for permission**

**8.6** The purpose of the request to reconsider a decision to refuse permission (rule 54.12(3)) is to identify the scope of the renewed application. The request must be succinct. It should identify which grounds are relied on in support of the renewed application, and address the reasons given by the Judge who refused permission on consideration of the papers.

**8.7** The standard time estimate for the hearing of a renewed application is 30 minutes (to include time for judgment). Any request for a longer listing must be stated in the application. In any event, within 7 days following the date the application was filed, the parties must tell the Court the agreed time estimate for the hearing.
## Rule 54.11—Service of Order Giving or Refusing Permission

**9.1** An order refusing permission or giving it subject to conditions or on certain grounds only must set out or be accompanied by the court’s reasons for coming to that decision.
## Rule 54.14—Response

**10.1**(1) If a party required to file Detailed Grounds has already filed Summary Grounds, he may (if all relevant matters have already been addressed in the Summary Grounds) inform the court and all other parties that the Summary Grounds will stand as his Detailed Grounds.
(2) If a party files and serves Detailed Grounds, that document should be as concise as possible, and shall not exceed 40 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 40-page limit.
(3) Where a party filing Detailed Grounds intends to rely on written evidence or on documents not already filed, he must prepare a paginated and indexed bundle containing that evidence and those documents. An electronic version of the bundle shall also be prepared in accordance with the Guidance on the Administrative Court website.

**10.2** The party shall file and serve electronic and hard copy versions of the bundle when he files and serves the Detailed Grounds.
## Rule 54.16—Evidence

**11.1** In accordance with the duty of candour, the defendant should, in its Detailed Grounds or evidence, identify any relevant facts, and the reasoning, underlying the measure in respect of which permission to apply for judicial review has been granted.

**11.2** Disclosure is not required unless the court orders otherwise.

**11.3** It will rarely be necessary in judicial review proceedings for the court to hear oral evidence. Any application under rule 8.6(2) for permission to adduce oral evidence or to cross-examine any witness must be made promptly, in accordance with the requirements of Part 23, and be supported by an explanation of why the evidence is necessary for the fair determination of the claim.
## Rule 54.15—Where Claimant Seeks to Rely on Additional Grounds

**12.1** Where the claimant intends to apply for judicial review on grounds additional to those set out in the Claim Form, the claimant must make an application to the court for permission to amend the Claim Form. The application should be made in accordance with the requirements of Part 23.

**12.2** The application must be made promptly and should include, or be accompanied by, a draft of the amended grounds and be supported by evidence explaining the need for the proposed amendment and any delay in making the application for permission to amend.

**12.3** The application, the proposed additional grounds and any written evidence, must be served on the defendant and any interested party named in the Claim Form or Acknowledgement of Service.

**12.4** For the purposes of determining an application to rely on additional grounds, rules 17.1 and 17.2 shall apply. Where permission to rely on additional grounds is given, the court may give directions as to amendments to be made to the defendant’s Grounds or Detailed Grounds and/or such other case management directions as appropriate.
## Rule 54.17—Court’s Powers to Hear Any Person

**13.1** An application for permission to intervene under rule 54.17 should be made by application in the relevant proceedings, in accordance with the provisions of Part 23.

**13.2** Any such application must be made promptly. The Court is unlikely to accede to an application to intervene if it would have the consequence of delaying the hearing of the relevant proceedings.

**13.3** The Application Notice must be served on all parties to the proceedings.

**13.4**(1) The duty of candour applies. The Application Notice should explain who the applicant is and indicate why and in what form the applicant wants to participate in the hearing.
(2) If the applicant requests permission to make representations at the hearing, the application should include a summary of the representations the applicant proposes to make.
(3) If the applicant requests permission to file and serve evidence in the proceedings a copy of that evidence should be provided with the Application Notice. The application should explain the relevance of any such evidence to the issues in the proceedings.

**13.5** If the applicant is seeking a prospective order as to costs which departs from the provision made by section 87 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015, the application must include a copy of the order sought and must set out the grounds on which that order is sought.

**13.6** Where the court gives permission for a person to file evidence or make representations at the hearing of the claim for judicial review (whether orally or in writing), it may do so on conditions and may give case management directions.

**13.7** Where all the parties consent, the court may deal with an application under [rule 54.17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0116692760&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)) without a hearing.
## Rule 54.20—Transfer

**14.1** Rule 30.5 provides the power to transfer proceedings between Divisions of the High Court and to and from a specialist list. In deciding whether a claim is suitable for transfer to the Administrative Court, the court will consider whether it raises issues of public law to which [Part 54](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0295220712&pubNum=121175&originatingDoc=I3F9EEBD0777811E79212DFEE3C6BBBA5&refType=UL&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&contextData=\(sc.Category\)) should apply.
## Skeleton arguments

**15.1** The purpose of a skeleton argument is to assist the court by setting out as concisely as practicable the arguments upon which a party intends to rely.

**15.2**(1) A skeleton argument must be concise. It should both define and confine the areas of controversy; be set out in numbered paragraphs; be cross-referenced to any relevant document in the bundle; be self-contained and not incorporate by reference material from previous skeleton arguments or pleadings; and should not include extensive quotations from documents or authorities. Documents to be relied on must be identified.
(2) Where it is necessary to refer to an authority, a skeleton argument must: state the proposition of law the authority demonstrates; and identify the parts of the authority that support the proposition. If more than one authority is cited in support of a given proposition, the skeleton argument must briefly state why.

**15.3** Skeleton Arguments shall not exceed 25 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 25-page limit.

**15.4** Any skeleton argument that does not comply with the requirements above may be returned to its author by the Administrative Court Office and may not be re-filed unless and until it complies with those requirements. The court may disallow the cost of preparing a skeleton argument which does not comply with these requirements.

**15.5** The claimant must file and serve a skeleton argument not less than 21 days before the date of the hearing (or the warned date).

**15.6** The defendant and any other party wishing to make representations at the hearing of the judicial review must file and serve a skeleton argument not less than 14 days before the date of the hearing (or the warned date).

**15.7** Not less than 7 days before the date of the hearing (or the warned date), the parties shall file: (a) an agreed list of issues; (b) an agreed chronology of events (with page references to the hearing bundle); and (c) an agreed a list of essential documents for the advance reading of the court (with page references in the hearing bundle to the passages relied on) and a time estimate for that reading.
## The hearing bundle and the authorities bundle

If the claimant is unable to comply with paragraph (b) or (c) or (d) above the Claim Form must contain or be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why.
