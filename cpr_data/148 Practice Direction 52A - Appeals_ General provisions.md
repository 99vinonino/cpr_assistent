## SECTION II – INTRODUCTION

**2.1** These Practice Directions apply to all appeals to which Part 52 applies.

**2.2** Part 52 complements the provisions of sections 54 to 57 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 and provides a uniform procedure for appeals in the county courts and the High Court and a modified procedure for the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal. Part 52 does not apply to –
(a) family proceedings in the High Court or county courts but does apply to appeals to the Court of Appeal from decisions made in family proceedings with such modifications as may be required;
(b) appeals in detailed assessment proceedings against the decision of an authorised court officer.
[To the top](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52/pd_part52#top)
## SECTION III – DESTINATIONS OF APPEAL

**3.1** Section 56 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 enables the Lord Chancellor to specify the destinations of appeal in different cases. The Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destinations of Appeal) Order 2016 specifies the general destinations of appeal which apply subject to any statutory provision to the contrary. Appeals in respect of individual insolvency and corporate insolvency proceedings are specified in section 375 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and rule 7.47 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 respectively.
The destinations of appeal provided by these provisions are explained in the following paragraphs of this section of this Practice Direction.

**3.2** ‘Statutory appeals’ and ‘Appeals by way of case stated’ are dealt with in PD52D – refer to those provisions for the appropriate court to which such an appeal may lie.

**3.3** The court or judge to which an appeal is to be made (subject to obtaining any necessary permission) is set out in the tables below–
Table 1 deals with appeals in proceedings other than family and insolvency proceedings;
Table 2 deals with appeals in insolvency proceedings; and
Table 3 deals with appeals in family proceedings which may be heard in the Family Division and to which the CPR may apply.

**3.4** Definitions of terms and abbreviations used in Tables 1, 2 and 3 –
‘Destination’: the court to which the appeal lies.
‘DJ’: District judge.
‘CJ’: Circuit judge including a recorder.
‘CJ (CC)’: Circuit judge in the county court.
“DC”: a Divisional Court.
‘Master’: Master, district judge sitting in a district registry or any other judge referred to in article 4 of the Destination of Appeals Order.
‘HCJ’: single judge of the High Court.
‘HCJ(FD)’: single judge of the family Division of the High Court.
‘CA’: Court of Appeal.
‘Companies Acts’ means the Companies Act 1985, the Companies Act 1989 and the Companies Act 2006.
‘Registrar’: a Registrar in Bankruptcy, including a salaried or fee paid Registrar in Bankruptcy
“SC”: the Supreme Court.
(Note: Tables 1, 2 and 3 do not include so-called ‘leap frog’ appeals either to the Court of Appeal pursuant to section 57 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 or to the Supreme Court pursuant to section 13 of the Administration of Justice Act 1969.)

**3.5** The destinations in the tables set out below apply in relation to first appeals, whether the decision is interim or final.
(For a second appeal (an appeal from a decision of the County Court or the High Court which was itself made on appeal), the destination is the Court of Appeal (save where section 13 of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 applies, or the original decision was a decision of an officer authorised to assess costs by the Lord Chancellor: see article 6 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) Order 2016).)

**5.1**
(1) The purpose of a skeleton argument is to assist the court by setting out as concisely as practicable the arguments upon which a party intends to rely.
(2) A skeleton argument must–
  * be concise;
  * both define and confine the areas of controversy;
  * be set out in numbered paragraphs;
  * be cross-referenced to any relevant document in the bundle;
  * be self-contained and not incorporate by reference material from previous skeleton arguments;
  * not include extensive quotations from documents or authorities.


(3) Documents to be relied on must be identified.
(4) Where it is necessary to refer to an authority, a skeleton argument must –
(a) state the proposition of law the authority demonstrates; and
(b) identify the parts of the authority that support the proposition.
If more than one authority is cited in support of a given proposition, the skeleton argument must briefly state why.
(5) The cost of preparing a skeleton argument which –
(a) does not comply with the requirements set out in this paragraph; or
(b) was not filed within the time limits provided by this Practice Direction (or any further time granted by the court),
will not be allowed on assessment except as directed by the court.

## SECTION VI – DISPOSING OF APPLICATIONS AND APPEALS BY CONSENT
### Dismissal of applications or appeals by consent

**6.1** An appellant who does not wish to pursue an application or appeal may request the appeal court to dismiss the application or the appeal. If such a request is granted it will usually be subject to an order that the appellant pays the costs of the application or appeal.

**6.2** If the appellant wishes to have the application or appeal dismissed without costs, his request must be accompanied by a letter signed by the respondent stating that the respondent so consents.

**6.3** Where a settlement has been reached disposing of the application or appeal, the parties may make a joint request to the court for the application or appeal to be dismissed by consent. If the request is granted the application or appeal will be dismissed.
[To the top](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52/pd_part52#top)
### Allowing unopposed appeals or applications on paper

**6.4** The appeal court will not normally make an order allowing an appeal unless satisfied that the decision of the lower court was wrong or unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity. The appeal court may, however, set aside or vary the order of the lower court by consent and without determining the merits of the appeal if it is satisfied that there are good and sufficient reasons for so doing. Where the appeal court is requested by all parties to allow an application or an appeal the court may consider the request on the papers. The request should set out the relevant history of the proceedings and the matters relied on as justifying the order and be accompanied by a draft order.
[To the top](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52/pd_part52#top)
### Disposal of applications and appeals involving children or protected parties

**6.5** Where one of the parties is a child or protected party, any disposal of an application or the appeal requires the court’s approval. A draft order signed by the parties’ solicitors should be sent to the appeal court, together with an opinion from the advocate acting on behalf of the child or protected party and, in the case of a protected party, any relevant documents prepared for the Court of Protection.
[To the top](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52/pd_part52#top)
## SECTION VII – REOPENING APPEALS (RULE 52.30)

**7.1** A party applying for permission to reopen an appeal or an application for permission to appeal must apply for such permission from the court whose decision the party wishes to reopen.

**7.2** The application for permission must be made by application notice and be supported by written evidence, verified by a statement of truth. A copy of the application for permission must not be served on any other party to the original appeal unless the court so directs.

**7.3** Where the court directs that the application for permission is to be served on another party, that party may, within 14 days of the service on him of the copy of the application, file and serve a written statement either supporting or opposing the application.

**7.4** The application for permission will be considered on paper by a single judge.
