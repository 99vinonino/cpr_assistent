**2.1** A witness summons may be issued in the High Court or the County Court in aid of a court or tribunal which does not have the power to issue a witness summons in relation to the proceedings before it[3](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part34/pd_part34a#f0284).

**2.2** A witness summons referred to in paragraph 2.1 may be set aside by the court which issued it[4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part34/pd_part34a#f0285).

**2.3** An application to set aside a witness summons referred to in paragraph 2.1 will be heard:

**2.4** Unless the court otherwise directs, the applicant must give at least 2 days’ notice to the party who issued the witness summons of the application, which will normally be dealt with at a hearing.

**3.3** The sum referred to in 3.2(2) is to be based on the sums payable to witnesses attending the Crown Court[6](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part34/pd_part34a#f0287).
